UIKit Fundamentals with Bob\n\n\n   \n\n\nPurpose\nI've started working on this course for 8 weeks. Since this is my first course,  there has been a number of internal issues and struggles. So far, I've deleted dozens of videos to meet my standard. However, I think I've finally found my way. For those who are new, this course is targeted towards Swift intermediates. To be more specific, it aims at those who've been learning Swift for 3-6 months, and you have an understanding of Objective-Oriented Programming, but you'd like to get used to the iOS ecosystem such as design patterns and practical skills.\nReference\nThis document will be used as the place for my students to download source code, practice problem answers, and all of my lecture notes. I've taken many courses on various platforms, but I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned so that I can always look back. Most instructors do not document because it takes a lot more time than making videos alone. However, I understand I'm the underdog. I have decided to choose this journey to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\nProgress update\nBecause I've gone through many trials and errors to produce courses that would provide as much value for my students, it's been taking a lot longer than I had expected. I hope this documentation would at least give you a progress update in terms of where I'm standing at. You can find out the latest update on the bottom.\nAdvertisement\nThis document will demonstrate the amount of research and preparation it requires to produce a single course. Prospective students might be able to find out how the course is structured by skimming through each section before they decide to purchase.\nLong Term Benefits\nSwift and iOS go through major updates each year. Compared to publishing a new version of a book, releasing a new video course takes up a lot more time due to editing and recording. However, if I organize my notes, practice problems, and scripts into a single basket, it becomes much easier to reproduce videos for future updates.\nVision\nI'd like to devote my career to teaching and helping the world. I'd like to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless wealth, religion, gender, sex, and race. I will continue to document my journey. Teaching iOS is one way for me to get started.\nOnce I get enough of revenue and income through making courses and writing books, I hope to run an online company that  provides unmatchable online education marketplaces for people all around the world. In 2017, there are leading online teaching platforms such as Udemy, Pluralsight, Treehouse, and Udacity. I have a bigger goal such as implementing Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality to teaching and connecting the world.\nContribution \nIf you've found this document on Github, you may read the entire lecture notes here.

Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, it doesn't mean it's going to be all those butterflies and rainbows. In fact, you will suffer.\nAlso, I'd like to clearly inform my students that this course isn't just about making apps or portfolio. In fact, you most likely never get a job simply by taking a couple courses on Udemy or other platforms. Being an iOS developer takes of time, energy, and patience. I'd like you to jot down or write down some key points what it takes to become an iOS developer or build your dream app.\nGround Rules\n\nNo excuses. I don’t take complainers: If your English isn’t good, go learn. Go to YouTube, in fact, English is my second language too, and I don’t have a computer science degree. All I did was I went to public libraries and read books and took notes. If I'm able to learn, you are also as well.  You've got amazing resources available online. If you can afford buying either a Mac or iPhone, you have more than plenty of resources to go your own.\nEmbrace Pain. If you aren’t struggling, then you are not learning. It doesn’t mean it can’t be fun. Why do people like to climb the mountain. Fly from the mountain. It’s because of the story, and the hardship makes success so much great. You have to accept that being an iOS developer is a rough path like climbing the mountain. But, you will get paid way more, about 2 times the average of the national income in the US. But you don’t have to become an iOS developer, but it’s always to good to produce your own app and possibly create something that changes and disrupts the world like Uber.\nDream Big. You may argue, more than half of people don’t download apps in a month, and it’s too competitive.But, Steve jobs once said, those who are crazy enough will change the world. Your mindset and vision, you will attain your goal with a bunch of failures.\nLearning is done by you. Before I write a single tutorial or blog articles, I spend quite a number of hours before I do. I learn while doing it, and so should you. When you learn something, make sure create a blog or simply use Medium like me so that I don’t have to worry about hosting. No excuses.\nBe skeptical. Don't trust me all the way. Make sure if you spot some of practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased and I might have bad practices. Challenge the norm and stand out\nDo not listen to Xcode. You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message and paste on Stack Overflow. Ask me questions. Do whatever you can.\n\n\nI mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to give you nets, but you have to use those nets by yourself. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of you. If you can't deal with it, then you are too soft.\n\nYour Ideal Learning Stage\nIt’s okay if you don’t understand the concept right away. However, you must check out resources multiple times besides just mine. If you still don’t get it, go to bed, sleep, and wake up and study again. That’s how I understand how to use closures in Swift 3 and completion handlers.\nNever ever click those red notifications on the left side of Xcode like question mark without knowing what’s going on underneath. You must absolutely understand. What does that mean? You need the fundamental of Swift. Learn how to read Apple Documentation. It’s so important. There are so many classes and functions that come up every iOS update, and the only thing is you watch WWDC ands start using them. Research first before you ask a single question. You must struggle first.\nCourse Design\n1. Personal Story: Every lesson should flow like a story. I will introduce some of pain points in real-life situation and then try to solve with them using Swift.\n2. Application: In order to solve the problem, I will then provide you with examples and introduce new concepts and also apply concepts in real life situation. Lecture: Screen and My Face and. PowerPoints, visual graphics, I continue explaining the concept using the laymen's term.\n3. Practice Problems: You have to solve those problems with yourself. I will have source code available for each problem.\n4. Resources: I've attached plenty of resources for you to study by attaching numerous other articles and YouTube videos if necessary. Including lecture notes.\n5. Independent Studies: By now, you've learned how to catch fish. You may explore more by learning on your own. If you still confused after numerous times of googling, you may ask the question to HipChat. If no one replies to you, try to send me an email. If I'm able to find your answer within the first 5 pages of Google, I will just give you the link.\nYou do the work: Do the challenge problem, think about this learning can be beneficial for your future endeavor or your current life. Don't be like a code monkey who just does the same over and over. Apply. If you are confused, take a look at the resources, if you are still confused, don't ask anyone. but google. Read through the entire firs 10 pages, and if you are still stuck, and then ask on Stack Overflow or Hipchat. You will be surprised how much you learn through the research phase just beyond the things you were confused about.\nLastly, I highly recommend you read an article I wrote, \"How to become an iOS Developer, Bob\". If you are interested in knowing more about my perspective on becoming a better developer.\n"},"0000/0005_Resources.html":{"url":"0000/0005_Resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nTo make your learning process more enjoyable with me, I provide what no other instructors have ever provided. I know this because I studied the market. I took every major online iOS course from every source including Lynda, Treehouse, Udemy, Plusralsite.\nHere are a list of resources that differentiate my course from the rest.\n\nHipChat. Unlike Slack but free for unlimited users. If you don't know HipChat or Slack, it's a group message app. The name of the group is called, iOS Geek Community. Feel free to introduce yourself under the welcome section. I share articles, updates, and so on. You guys can create your own group. Make sure create a private group so that no other can see the group. We don't want to have too many. By creating a private group, you may form a study group and partners to learn together. Who knows you guys might find great partners. You can find the link right here, and download the app and join for free for unlimited users!\nSwift Beginner's Book: If you are not confident with Swift programming language but you are good with Objective-C or other programming langauges, this is a $19.99 book I'm currently selling. Feel free to buy this! Just kidding, I'm giving it for free for you to study. You will be able to learn the basics of Object Orietned Programming although I already expect you to know this by now. This book is in a series.  There's Part 2 and Part 3 for Swift. So feel free to study them if you feel like you want to compare yourself whether you are a good Swift developer.\nEmail list if you'd like to be on my email which I often give out premium content for free such as this course, upcoming courses for Practical Protocol, Functional, and MVVM. You guys can stay up to date with me. Everyone on the email all have sent me emails to on this email list so I treat them with care and I read and reply to all messages even if you send me a word or two. My principle is that I don't collect your email just to spam or for the sake numbers. I believe in quality over quantity. I believe in long term relationships over short-term sales. If you are interested in, shoot me a quick emailing describing who you are, and I will get you on the list!\nLecture Notes: This is truly what separates me from the rest instructors out there. I've made an organized online documentation/ebook. This is my script for the beginning and also the conclusion. Lecture notes, and so on. The reason I do this, I understand Swift has iOS has an update every year. In order to be very first person to market, I need stay organized, and also provide consistent value for my students. The reason for you is that It contains source code which has the answers for all the challenges for each lesson. Also very brief explanation that helps you bring back your memory. It could be used as your reference. You'd be surprised how much research and prep go through for each lesson. But, I'm looking for long term, so this way of documenting everything will help me in the future.\nBlogs: I publish one article per week. This is where everything got started. You will find tons of great content that's not covered in this course such as tips and my biased perspectives!\nJourney: Last, and the least, if you are interested in my personal journey and my daily thought, feel free to read my public diary.\n\n"},"1000/1100/1100_intro.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1100_intro.html","title":"Swift Fundamentals","keywords":"","body":"Intermediate Swift 3 Fundamentals\nHave you been frustrated by those red marks on the left side of your Xcode?

When I first started programming in Swift just like many of you, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, I bought books and whatever resources I could acquire to learn iOS programming by myself.\nUntil for another month, I never really understood what those ? and ! stood for. Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, you know what I'm talking. I got frustrated. It seemed like no courses gave me clear reasons how to use optionals, and why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Well, today, you are going to learn why fundamentally we use optionals and how to use it with me, Bob the Developer.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRule\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe Type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value or nil.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptional type allows storing nil.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet myNewName: String? = nil\n\nprint(myName)\nprint(myNewName)\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nMust Convert Optionals to Normal Type for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\n// robAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap Optionals to Normal Types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\nForced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if an optional contains nil. To convert, add !.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\n\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\n\nAgain, forced Unwrapping is not recommended as shown below.\n\nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\n// let newBobAge = bobAge! // Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to normal type in Swift. It violates the rule mentioned above.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"Bob's pretty image\"\n\nif let image = profileImageFromFacebook {\n  print(image)\n}\n\nSource Code\n1101_Optionals\nResources\nFeel free to check if you are confused.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Lesson12_Optionals\nConclusion\nBoom! Now you finally understand the why Swift engineering have implemented optionals and how to use them. To be more specific, you've learned two fundamental concepts in optionals. The rule number one is that every variable type even if it's optionals type has to be defined whether explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are ways to unwrap optionals to normal values. Force using the ! mark and safe using if let. In our next lesson, you are learning how to apply optionals when you create an object and play around with its properties and methods.

Just to recap, in our previous lesson, you've learned why we optionals, and there are two ways to unwrap. But, have you ever wondered why you see those ? and ! automatically added when you randomly try to get properties and methods in object? If you haven't, that's okay. You will find out. The goal is to prevent you from guessing and checking. Let's find out what's really going under the hood. Let's begin!\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nWhy do I see \"?\" and \"!\" when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nDesign Human\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance called bob.\nlet bob = Human(name: \"Bob\")\nbob.name\nbob.sayHello()\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate Apartment class that contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance and assign the human property.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nCall Property\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an optional since human is optional.\n\n// Implicit Unwrap\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\n\nSource Code\n1102_Optional Chaining\nResources\nIf you are not familiar with Object Oriented Programming, feel free to upgrade your game and come back, although I expect you are familiar with OOP.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Object Oriented Programming: Structure\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Object Oriented Programming: Inheritance\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Object Oriented Programming: Initializers\nConclusion\nNow, you no longer have to guess when to use ? and ! mark when you are working with objects such as UIKit. Please remember that if you see any ? then make sure you unwrap implicitly. If you have any questions, make sure check out resources and HipChat if you have any questions.\nIn our next lesson, you are learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap and why you use it in the first place instead of using if let.

We are at lesson 3 of Part 1 of Swift fundamentals with Bob. First of all, let me share with you a story of mine first. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an else-if statement. It wasn't a big deal. For example, if something is true, you run this block, if not, else, you run that. However, a guard statement confused the heck out of me. I don't know why. Maybe some of you guys feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. But a guard statement provides a feeling zen which means clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Well, let's find out why.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nIs there any better way to write an else-if statement? How do you safely unwrap many optionals?\nTypical else-if\nWithout knowing guard statements, you used a long else-if statement to handle an error message block by calling else.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with else-if\n\nNested brackets\nRead every line to spot error\n\nGuard Statement\nIt provides early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"You can't drink\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with else-if\n// Unwrap using else-if\n\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"URL\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = 21\n\n// If I find \"nil\" in any of these variables, don't do anything\n\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n         print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your face right here, \\(photo), you are \\(age)\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    // Animation Logic\n    // Networking\n  }\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Guard\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing a conditional statement, but also used as a way to safely/implicitly unwrap optionals.\nfunc safetlyUnwrapUsingGuard() {\n\n  guard let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge else {\n    //  If  one or more optionals contain nil\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  // All optionals contain non-nil\n  print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your, \\(photo). You are \\(age).\")\n  // Animation Logic\n  // Networking\n  // More Code, but still zen\n}\n\nSource Code\n1103_Guard Statement\nResources\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Guard Statement\nConclusion\nBoom, What's going on? How was the lesson just now? I hope you understand the power of using a guard statement that it provides an early exit and you don't have to read all the way to the bottom. You are using a guard statement not because just to please yourself, but also for the sake of your teammate's hair so it doesn't turn grey when he/she is reading your code. Okay, great. In next our lesson, we are going to learn another ! and ? for type casting which allows you to convert types.

I think you might be a little tired of seeing these ! and ? since Lesson 1. However, this is the most confusing concept in Swift, so we had to go over. I just wanted to be on the same as you guys are. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created classes. I don't think I need to talk to much. I will show the example right away. Let's dive into.\nLecture Notes\nSource Code\n1104_Type Casting\nResources\nIf you are still confused with type casting, feel free to watch my YouTube video.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorials with Bob: Type Casting\nConclusion\nGreat job, if you've understood what type casting is finally. It is somewhat similar to optionals right? You've learn two ways convert types. One is upcasting, as, which always works because you are going up to super class and you getting rid of properties and methods. The other way downcasting which is become more specific, but as you've seen it may work and may not work. Therefore you use either as?to safely convert or as! to force convert. You are going to find out how type casting is such a beautiful thing when it comes to grouping objets. You will find out in Part 2 of this course. I know you are excited, just bear with me for a second. In our next lesson, we are going to deal with another ? and !. It's going to be the last one, and you will no longer fear those red signs on the left.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html","title":"Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of Part 1: Swift Intermediates with Bob.

I will walk you through, and let's find out!\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the motivation for using Swift Errror Handling snytax such as catch, do, and try instead of writing a else-if statement to handle unexpected outcomes. You've also learned the differences between try, try?, and try!. You can only use try when you use it within a do block. However, if you don't care about catching errors that thrown, you may use try? and try!. But make sure never use ! because it can crash at any time.\nThat's it guys. You've covered the entire ! and ? such as type casting, error handling, optionals, and optional chaning. I'm so proud of how much you've come, and you will find out how these Swift concepts play a major role in Part 2 of the course and of course Part 3.

In this lesson you are going learn how to design an init method that, first, possibly returns no object and, second, even throw an error using error handling. I understand it sounds quite confusing to you right now. So, let's dive into it.\nLecture Notes\nResources\nIntro to Error Handling:  https://medium.com/ios-geek-community/intro-to-error-handling-in-swift-3-edb2ce6a6668#.2uk9hyp7h\nSource Code\n1202_Failable Init\nConclusion\nYou've done two things with me in this lesson. First, you've learned how design an init method can return nil or optional type by putting a ? right to the init. As we talked about it before. Anything that has ? in Swift will give you an optional value. Second, you've revisited error handling. The throws keyword is not only used within an else-if block, but also it can used for an init method. Take care, keep practicing and developing your skill my friend.

Haven't? No worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine. Let's dive into it.\nLecture Notes\nResources\nSource Code\n1203_Computed Property\nConclusion\nBoom! In the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a gettable property by calling get or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add set which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps.

A lot of beginners often just type because of what they have seen on StackOver Flow or tutorials, today we are going to dive in what's really going on. There are a lot of examples, so let's get started with me, Bob the Developer.\nLecture Notes\nResources\nSource Code\n1204_Override Init/Method\nConclusion\nNow, you understand. What's really going on with super.init, super.viewDidLoad, override, super.property. By now, I hope you understand why we use super. Again, I like to use this analogy when it comes to iOS development. Building an app in this ecosystem is like operating a microwave. We definitely need to know how to read manuals which is analogous to being able to read the Swift programming language. To heat up your food, all you have to do is press a couple of buttons and then lights comes off from the side of the wall and the food starts heating up. We don't know exactly how the details work such as particle movements and electromagnetism, but we do know how to operate,  In iOS programming, our job is to learn how to operate and understand why Apple engieers have implemented such features such as Error Handling and Computer Property. Remember this statement,\n\nFocus on why we use it over why it works. You understand their motives, not the principle behind it because you can't understand why it works. It just works. Microwave jsut works. When you tap on your phone, it just works. Why they did it because it's convenient and easy to use it. Why it works? It's too complicated.

Do you know what a trailing closure is and when to use it? If you weren't able to confidently answer to these questions, you've come to the right place. A lot of books and courses do not cover the fundamentals and expects new developers to use them. It's analogous to not knowing what super.viewDidLoad is but you just use it because it somehow works. There are of completion handlers used. You've seen before because it is used for networking, going to the next View Controller, animation, and so on. We don't want that to happen.

When I learned Swift as my firsts programming language, I had a really hard time understanding closures. I avoided it as much as possible, and I didn't know why we use it in the first place. It took me good 3 months to completely understand Closures. So, I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures taking by taking a couple of lessons. It is hard, and you just have to admit it. It's riding a bicycle for the first time. You just have to fall and feel uncomfortable until you get used it. It's like seeing a mathematical formula you've never seen before. You just have to get used it. Enough said, let's find out how closures is different from normal functions. Brace yourself.\nResources\nSource Code\n1301_Closures vs Functions\nClosure Part 1\nClosure Part 2\nConclusion\nDo you feel uncomfortable or confused? That's okay. It's just a part of the process of acquiring knowledge. You struggle to learn because it indicates that you are not in your comfort zone. Learning is done by your. So, if you need to, refer to my resources, and google until you figure out what's going on. Don't give up. I hope you are able to distinguish the difference between a function and variable. Remember you can store a function into a variable and carry it around. Also, when you make a closure, you must indicate its type. You've learned how to write a closure statement using longer as well as shorter syntax by putting dollar signs and eliminating in and return.

Before I talk about details, I'd like to share with you that learning Protocol was such a daunting task. Not only it was located at the end of the Swift documentation, but it just felt really foreign to me. It sounded scary. Of course, it feels natural to use it, so I understand if you are not comfortable with it. I just would like to tell you that you might have to watch this video multiple times to get by. You might have to read 10 more articles for you to fully get comfortable. I really expect you guys to be proactive when you are confused. I will do my part which is to explain in the most clear way possible. Well, let's get started from the bottom with me. Let's go!\nLecture Notes\nThere are certainly benefits of using OOP, but the opposites as well.\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. Your object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can f up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\nResources\nSource Code\n1401_Protocol Basics\nConclusion\nAre you wrapping your heads around? Again, make sure you remember a couple rules. If you use { get } or { get set }. You can both use it as a stored property and change the value as you wish. However, if you identify a property with { get set } please remember if you use computed property, you have to make it settable as well. For { get }, you can do whatever you want.
