## Conclusion
Great! Do you think you learned something with me? I'm sure you have. The whole purpose of using property observer is to write less code but provide greater readability. You don't have to create a bunch of Switch or else-if statement, functions to do what we did. As you've seen there are ways ways to check whether user has been logged or not, computed property for me at least, works the best because it provides a separate block of code. Keep developing your skills and keep learning. See you byebye.
