## Conclusion
You've completed Chapter 2 Advanced Object Oriented Programming with me. If you've learned programming before, you may start imagining how all these learnings and tips come together to make better, solid, programs whether it is for your app or just for your life. We've got two more chapters before we jump into the iOS ecosystem along with the UIKit library.

I'm really happy for you because you've come to the right place with me Bob the Developer. If you want to keep learning about iOS development, feel free to follow me on my blog. So that you don't miss out on any useful and fun tips for you guys.

 In our next chapter, we are going to learn one of the most dreaded topics in iOS programming for beginners: Closures and introduction to functional programming. I'm super excited to continue off this journey with you. Let's begin!
