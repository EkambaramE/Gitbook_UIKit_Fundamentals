# Resources
Here are a list of resources that differentiate my course from the rest. I really want you to learn because I care about long-term relationships with you.

### Lecture Notes
 I've made an organized online documentation/ebook. This is my script for the beginning and also the conclusion. You may download the notebook so that you may study while you are in the plane. It contains a brief explanation that helps you bring back your memory. It is also used as your reference by you may search on the left top corner. It also shows how much research and preparation it requires for to produce a single lecture. Since I'm looking for long term relationships, and I feel great to document my journey and provide as much as value for my students. It is also mobile-friendly so that you may study when you are even in the bathroom.

### Group Chat
Discord is a group message chat application. Feel free to introduce yourself under the `welcome` section. I share articles, updates, and so on. You may send highlighted syntax and help each other. Also, I wil try my best to show up as well. You can join the group right [Here](https://discord.gg/smmmD5B). Unlike Slack or other platforms, it's free 24/7 both for you and me.

### Supporting Articles
I publish one article per week. You will find tons of great content that's not possibly covered in this course such as tips and my biased perspectives on learning and becoming an iOS Developer. You may visit my blog called, [iOS Geek Community](https://medium.com/ios-geek-community).

### Social Media
You can follow me on social media so that you are able to see how I live my life especially on Instagram. Also, I put regular and personal updates on Facebook Page, so feel free to follow me there and engage.

### Email List
 if you'd like to be on my email list I often give out premium content for free such as this course, upcoming courses for Practical Protocol, Functional, and MVVM. I engage heavily on the list. In fact, hundreds of people signed up this course and received free coupons. So you want deals like one of those, why not shoot me an email. I don't sell there. Everyone on the list has sent me emails before so it's not for everyone. I believe in long term relationships over short-term sales. If you are interested in, shoot me a quick email describing who you are, and I will get you on the list. And let's talk.
