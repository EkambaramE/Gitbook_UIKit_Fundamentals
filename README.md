# Introduction
Hi, I'm Bob. I'm currently creating a course on Udemy. After having relied on Evernote, I discovered I had to be more organized with images, source code, practice problems. This documentation will give you an overview of what the course will be like. There are about 200 people who are waiting for the course, so I also believe this is one way for me to show transparency and progress.

## Audience
Anyone who has played around with Swift for 3 - 6 months. You already have an understanding of Object Oriented Programming, and you are familiar with the Xcode ecosystem, but you aren't confident.

## How to use this document
This document will be used for notes and problem sets. This note will be used for you to study in-detail beyond my teaching. This documentation contains all the necessary files, code, and preparation and answer keys for practice problems.

If you've found this document on Github, you may read the entire lecture notes [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bobleesj/udemy_uikit_fundamentals_notes/details).
