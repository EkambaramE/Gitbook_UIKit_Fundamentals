# Course Expectation
Based on the Stack Overflow [survey] in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many programming languages out there. In fact, you will suffer, and I want it that way. Let me explain.

## Embrace Struggle
Consuming knowledge goes against the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics that things in nature want to remain scattered. What we do everyday defies the law. It's organic to struggle.

It doesnâ€™t mean struggles can't be fun. Perhaps, people attempt to climb the highest mountain and try to hold breath in icy water despite death threat. Struggles produce stories filled with hardships. They allow us to appreciate success.

These are my favorite lines from one of my favorite songs called, [Let her go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA) by Passenger.
> Only know you love her when you let her go

> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

## Document
I'd like you to document your learning journey. You no longer have to create a website. You may blog on Medium or use Evernote. You may share with your friends. Your learning journey will be difficult. But once you get it and share with someone else, you will feel more accomplished. I guess that's why I love blogging.


## Be Skeptical
 Iâ€™m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. ðŸ˜… If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.

## Be Proactive
You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring.

> I mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. Iâ€™m here to teach you how to catch fish. Iâ€™m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.


# Your Ideal Learning Stage
### 1. The Why
Each lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn such materials and features

### 2. Application
After having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.

### 3. Resources
I attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.

### 4. Visualization
It's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough in 2017, by the current education system.

### 5. Test
It's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new.
