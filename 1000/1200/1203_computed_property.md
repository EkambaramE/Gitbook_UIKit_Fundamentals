## Conclusion
Boom! In the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a `gettable` property by calling `get` or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add `set` which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps. You will learn how everything fits together in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course. Keep developing your skills and take care bye bye.
