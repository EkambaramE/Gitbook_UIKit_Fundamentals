## Purpose
As a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning. If you are interested in knowing more about its content, please visit [here](0000/0002_Course_Overview.md).


## Reference
This is a platform for my students to download source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less travelled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.


## Personal Motivation
Since I was young, I have been grateful for what learning has offered so far. It would have been impossible for me create this course or even write a blog post. It would have been impossible for me to speak in English and reach out to more people.

I'd like to contribute back. My goal is to provide affordable top learning channels for all people regardless of gender, color, race, economic, and any background. I believe hard work met with constant learning allows anyone to rise up. I have started off with teaching iOS development. I'm at the very early stage just getting started. Meanwhile, I'd like to raise as much as funds so that I could invest and build a company that meets VR/AR so that everyone has access to learning.
