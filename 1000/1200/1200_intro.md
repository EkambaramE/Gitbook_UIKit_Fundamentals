# Advanced Object Oriented programming
Welcome back! Are you ready to learn? I'm ready and pumped. Although I expect you guys to have a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming, I just wanted to make sure we are on the same page. So that when we build apps in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course, you already know what I'm talking about. For those who feel confident with OOP but you don't know when to use it, you've come to the right place as well.

Welcome to the very first lesson of this chapter, advanced Object Oriented Programming. So far, you should definitely what it means to initialize an object using `Struct` and `Class`. In fact, we've been doing it for awhile. You should know also definitely know what it means to have properties and methods within an object.

Remember guys, OOP is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. You can't go against it. I can't make apps without using OOP because that's what Apple engineers have designed this platform to be. For instance, UIViewController contains numerous properties and methods and super classes associated with it.

I think it was enough of talking. Let's keep learning, you will be surprised how much you will improve just after going through this chapter with me.
