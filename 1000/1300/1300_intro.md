# Closures
Welcome to Part 1 Chapter 3: Complete Closures Lessons with me. You've probably heard or used closures before. So, let me as you this, do you know what completion handlers are used for? If you do, do you know how to build one? Do you know what a trailing closure is and when to use it? If you weren't able to confidently answer to these questions, you've come to the right place. A lot of books and courses do not cover the fundamentals and expects new developers to use them. It's analogous to not knowing what `super.viewDidLoad` is but you just use it because it somehow works. There are of completion handlers used. You've seen before because it is used for networking, going to the next View Controller, animation, and so on. We don't want that to happen. Again, we do not question why it works. We question why it is that way.
