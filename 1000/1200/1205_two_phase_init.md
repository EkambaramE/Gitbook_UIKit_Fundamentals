# Two Phase Init

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 5 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. In this lesson, you are going to learn how can one init method init the other. Sounds super confusing? Well, let's find out how it certainly works. In fact, it's super important. You will find out why by the end of this lesson. It could have three million dollars for NASA.

## Conclusion
Great, to be honest, I haven't used two phase init in my previous apps before, but I just wanted to make sure when you read someone's code, you are ready to rock and roll. But, you could create a program that allow you to convert easily.

The Mars Climate robot launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, Martian atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars .However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound (force)-seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) $327.6 million total gone.
