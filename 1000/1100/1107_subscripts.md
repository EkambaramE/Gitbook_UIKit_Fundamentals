# Subscripts

## Introduction
Welcome back to lesson 7 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob. What if I told you right now that you can create a shortcut? I know it sounds super super abstract. But, I will walk you through. I know you guys trust me more than any. Let's dive into it.

## Conclusion
Great, Now do you know what I mean by creating a shortcut? I'm sure now you do. I told you so. However, subscripts can be quite misleading because there is no name to it. As a result, it might confusion if your teammate starts to read your code, and he/she might get confused. So make sure, don't use it too often. Somtimes, it might be better for you to use a property or method for clarity. An Apple engineering once said, brevity is not the worthwhile goal. Communication is important because programming langauge is not only the way humans talk to computers, but also between a human to human.
