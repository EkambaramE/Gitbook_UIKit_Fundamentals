## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 3 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming. You should be guilty if you haven't thought about how POP can be applied in your future app. If you are just consuming without thinking. You are a zombie. You are passive. You are not going to learn. Stop being passive. Think. Well, let's learn more about Protocol Oriented Programming. You will be awed.

## Conclusion
That's great. Again, you've learned how to apply generics to protocol. Keep imagining and thinking how Protocol Oriented Programming can be applied in your code right now. Keep thinking. Imagining, wake the fuck up. Don't reply on me. Don't expect me to feed you. If you are thinking, great job. I'm really proud of you. In the next lesson, you are going to learn the most important concept in iOS programming. If you don't understand this, you are just going to be a code monkey. If you are confused, keep searching and googling. Again, don't rely on me. Let's learn delegate.
