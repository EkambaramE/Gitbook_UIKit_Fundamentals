# Purpose
I've started working on this course for 8 weeks. Since this is my first course,  there has been a number of internal issues and struggles. So far, I've deleted dozens of videos to meet my standard. However, I think I've finally found my way. For those who are new, this course is targeted towards Swift intermediates. To be more specific, it aims at those who've been learning Swift for 3-6 months, and you have an understanding of Objective-Oriented Programming, but you want to get used to the Xcode ecosystem.

## Reference
This document will be used as the place for my students to download source code, practice problem answers, and all of my lecture notes. I've taken many courses on various platforms, but I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned so that I can always look back. Most instructors do not document because it takes a lot more time than making videos from unorganized notes. However, I, as an underdog, have decided to choose this journey to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.

## Progress update
Because I've gone through many trials and errors to produce courses that would provide as much value for my students, it's been taking a lot longer than I had expected. I hope this documentation would at least give you a progress update in terms of where I'm standing at. You can find out the latest update on the bottom.

## Advertisement
This document will demonstrate the amount of research and preparation it requires to produce a single course. Prospective students might be able to find out how the course is structured by skimming through each section before they decide to purchase.

## Long Term Benefits
Swift and iOS go through major updates each year. Compared to publishing a new version of a book, releasing a new video course takes up a lot more time due to editing and recording. However, if I organize my notes, practice problems, and scripts into a single basket, it becomes much easier to reproduce videos for future students.

## Vision
 I'd like to devote my entire career to teaching and helping the world. I'd like to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless wealth, religion, gender, sex, and race. I will continue to document my journey. Teaching iOS is one way for me to get started. Once I get enough of revenue and income through making courses and writing books, I plan to build a company in Silicon Valley and provide unmatchable online education marketplaces for people all around the world. In 2017, there are leading online teaching places such as `Udemy`, `Pluralsight`, `Treehouse`, and `Udacity`. But, I have a bigger goal such as implementing Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality to teaching and connecting the world. I imagine poor kids in Africa/Asia learning how to make robots and practical gadgets for their community through our platform.
