# Conclusion
First of all, I'd like to congratulate on your process. How was learning going for you? We've covered the basics of the Swift Intermediate Fundamentals many books and courses skip due to complexity.

There is so much more for you. In Chapter 2, 3, and 4, you will continue to learn Swift with me so that when you start building real apps, you will see how everything comes together.

 Steve Jobs once said, when we are at the present moment, we can't really understand how certain incidents or knowledge build our future. He said, however, when you look into the past, you understand how the dots are connected. For example, Steve Jobs took a calligraphy course in college. The skill he learned allowed him to produce tremendous products that took our breath away.

 I, as your instructor, have designed your future, of course within a  spectrum of this course only. If you feel as if you don't really know why you are learning certain features of Swift, although you shouldn't feel a criss, when you start making real apps in Part 2 and Part 3, you will start to see how everything fits together. So, if you will, please follow my lead, and I want you to to learn and grow together.
