# Introduction to Protocol

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 1 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming. Before I talk about details, I'd like to share with you that learning Protocol was such a daunting task. Not only it was located at the end of the Swift documentation, but it just felt really foreign to me. It sounded scary. Of course, it feels natural to use it, so I understand if you are not comfortable with it. I just would like to tell you that you might have to watch this video multiple times to get by. You might have to read 10 more articles for you to fully get comfortable. I really expect you guys to be proactive when you are confused. I will do my part which is to explain in the most clear way possible. Well, let's get started from the bottom with me. Let's go!

## Lecture Notes

There are certainly benefits of using OOP, but the opposites as well.
When you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. Your object becomes unnecessarily bloated.
When you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.
Since objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can f up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)

## Conclusion
Are you wrapping your heads around? Again, make sure you remember a couple rules. If you use { get } or { get set }. You can both use it as a stored property and change the value as you wish. However, if you identify a property with { get set } please remember if you use computed property, you have to make it settable as well. For { get }, you can do whatever you want. In our next lesson, you are going to see some of practical aspects of Protocol. You've only seen the tip of an ice berg. Let's get started my friend. Super excited to make you smarter.
