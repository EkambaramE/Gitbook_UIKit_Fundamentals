# The Life Cycle of an iOS App


This is pretty dope.
Wow, I love it. It's changing dynamically.

Wow, this is real time bro? Wow, I love it. hahahah. I should have used it quite often.



This is not. This is. I don't know what's happening. But this is working.

```swift
func hello() {
  print("My name is Bob").
  print("My name is Bobby")
}

class UIViewController {
  print("Hello")
}
```

<br>

```swift

import Foundation

let a = NSMutableArray(array: [1,2,3])
let b:NSArray = a

a.insert(4, at: 3)
print(b)


// I don't want to be able to mutate d
let d = c.copy() as! NSArray c.insert(4, at: 3)
d // ( 1, 2, 3 )
```
