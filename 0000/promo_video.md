## Problem
-  Have you seen those red marks on the left side of Xcode but you didn't know how to deal with them?
-  Have you taken numerous courses and books, but you weren't able to create you own app, and you don't feel confident sharing your code with someone else?
- Have you ever felt you've been copying off from the screen like a code monkey without understanding what's going on?

As a developer who started with Swift as the first programming language, I've gone through the pains and struggles you have. I had no idea, such as `delegate = self`, `get`,  `set`,   and completion handlers. And the instructors kept going lessons after lessons without resources available. I got massively confused which design patterns to follow and so on. I quit and bought another courses. The vicious cycle continued. I wasted time and money.

As a blogger and instructor, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've read hundreds of questions asking, "Bob, how can I write better code?", Out of frustration that there wasn't any decent intermediate resources available, I decided to create this course for my younger self, and of course, for you.

This course isn't about making 18 apps to become a paid developer. This course is about learning how to become independent on your own. Perhaps, If you really want to just make apps, why not just download from Github.  Here, we do not care about final products. We care about learning and process and progress. Because I believe, if you know how to use tools, you can build any.

## Introduction
I'm Bob, also known as Bob the Developer. I run one of the fastest growing blogs called, `iOS Geek Community` with over thousands of daily visitors and near million views from students and iOS developers all around the world.

Before I talk about what's inside of this course, I'd like to address why trust me, and so that you don't waste your money, and most importantly, your time. I'm all about building long-term relationships with my students. Had I not followed this principle, it would've been impossible for my work to get any traction. I care about my reputation and personal brand more than anyone. As a result, quality matters to me. On top of that, I've conducted surveys from hundred readers of mine, and I've put everything together into a single basket for you to consume and swallow.

## Course Structure
This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, you will learn topics I struggled the most with such as `Optionals`, `Type Casting`, `Optional Chaining`. You will learn why Swift engineering have implemented features and how and when to use them  You will learn advanced Objet Oriented Programming: `Property Observer`, `Convenience init`, `Two phase init`, and the meaning of `super` and `override init`.  Then, Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming such as `delegate`, `protocol extension`. Lastly, Intro to Functional Programming: `completion handlers`, and `closures`.

 In Part 2, you will grasp an overview of the iOS ecosystem including the life cycle of an app and view. Three ways to send data between view controllers and which one to use. Then, the UIKit Components such as `Autolayout`, protocol-oriented `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`. You will build apps programmatically to increase productivity and control of your app.  You will implement best design patterns and architecture that I've researched and practiced for a year with Swift.

in Part 3, you will incorporate everything you've learned in Part 1 and Part 2 to make an app. Instead of using core-data, you will learn how to use a modern database, called, Realm and real-time data sync through cloud computing provided by DigitalOcean.

## Call to Action
What differentiate myself from the rest is that I provide great resources along with lecture notes and dozens of supporting articles and YouTube videos I have carefully designed for this course. On top of that, if you are stuck, you may join our group chat and ask questions and collaborate with others. This course is $50 and I will not provide any discount because I believe I provide enough value for those who enroll. I wish not to dilute my brand through massive discount.

However, If you are from third world countries and it puts too much of financial burden on your shoulder, feel free to send me an email. I will be more than happy to help you out. I grew up in those countries so I understand it's not right to charge everyone the same despite unequal purchasing power.

 If you want to learn and grow together and become independent, I welcome you to join me and our exciting journey. See you soon.
