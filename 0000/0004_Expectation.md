# Course Expectation
Despite all the hype about learning how to build your first app, I'd like to give you a cold and harsh reality. Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, it doesn't mean it's going to be all those butterflies and rainbows. In fact, you will suffer.

Also, I'd like to clearly inform my students that this course isn't just about making apps or portfolio. In fact, you most likely never get a job simply by taking a couple courses on Udemy or other platforms. Being an iOS developer takes of time, energy, and patience. I'd like you to jot down or write down some key points what it takes to become an iOS developer or build your dream app.

## Ground Rules
1. **No excuses**. I don’t take complainers: If your English isn’t good, go learn. Go to YouTube, in fact, English is my second language too, and I don’t have a computer science degree. All I did was I went to public libraries and read books and took notes. If I'm able to learn, you are also as well.  You've got amazing resources available online. If you can afford buying either a Mac or iPhone, you have more than plenty of resources to go your own.

2. **Embrace Pain**. If you aren’t struggling, then you are not learning. It doesn’t mean it can’t be fun. Why do people like to climb the mountain. Fly from the mountain. It’s because of the story, and the hardship makes success so much great. You have to accept that being an iOS developer is a rough path like climbing the mountain. But, you will get paid way more, about 2 times the average of the national income in the US. But you don’t have to become an iOS developer, but it’s always to good to produce your own app and possibly create something that changes and disrupts the world like Uber.

3. **Dream Big**. You may argue, more than half of people don’t download apps in a month, and it’s too competitive.But, Steve jobs once said, those who are crazy enough will change the world. Your mindset and vision, you will attain your goal with a bunch of failures.

4. **Learning is done by you**. Before I write a single tutorial or blog articles, I spend quite a number of hours before I do. I learn while doing it, and so should you. When you learn something, make sure create a blog or simply use Medium like me so that I don’t have to worry about hosting. No excuses.

5. **Be skeptical**. Don't trust me all the way. Make sure if you spot some of practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased and I might have bad practices. Challenge the norm and stand out

6. **Do not listen to Xcode**. You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message and paste on Stack Overflow. Ask me questions. Do whatever you can.

> I mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to give you nets, but you have to use those nets by yourself. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of you. If you can't deal with it, then you are too soft.

## Your Ideal Learning Stage
It’s okay if you don’t understand the concept right away. However, you must check out resources multiple times besides just mine. If you still don’t get it, go to bed, sleep, and wake up and study again. That’s how I understand how to use closures in Swift 3 and completion handlers.

Never ever click those red notifications on the left side of Xcode like question mark without knowing what’s going on underneath. You must absolutely understand. What does that mean? You need the fundamental of Swift. Learn how to read Apple Documentation. It’s so important. There are so many classes and functions that come up every iOS update, and the only thing is you watch WWDC ands start using them. Research first before you ask a single question. You must struggle first.

## Course Design
**1. Personal Story:** Every lesson should flow like a story. I will introduce some of pain points in real-life situation and then try to solve with them using Swift.

**2. Application:** In order to solve the problem, I will then provide you with examples and introduce new concepts and also apply concepts in real life situation. Lecture: Screen and My Face and. PowerPoints, visual graphics, I continue explaining the concept using the laymen's term.

**3. Practice Problems:** You have to solve those problems with yourself. I will have source code available for each problem.

**4. Resources:** I've attached plenty of resources for you to study by attaching numerous other articles and YouTube videos if necessary. Including lecture notes.

**5. Independent Studies:** By now, you've learned how to catch fish. You may explore more by learning on your own. If you still confused after numerous times of googling, you may ask the question to HipChat. If no one replies to you, try to send me an email. If I'm able to find your answer within the first 5 pages of Google, I will just give you the link.

You do the work: Do the challenge problem, think about this learning can be beneficial for your future endeavor or your current life. Don't be like a code monkey who just does the same over and over. Apply. If you are confused, take a look at the resources, if you are still confused, don't ask anyone. but google. Read through the entire firs 10 pages, and if you are still stuck, and then ask on Stack Overflow or Hipchat. You will be surprised how much you learn through the research phase just beyond the things you were confused about.

Lastly, I highly recommend you read an article I wrote, "How to become an iOS Developer, Bob". If you are interested in knowing more about my perspective on becoming a better developer.
