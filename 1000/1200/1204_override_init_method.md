# Override Init

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 4 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. In this lesson, you are going to learn what it truly means by the world `super`. A lot of beginners often just type because of what they have seen on StackOver Flow or tutorials, today we are going to dive in what's really going on. There are a lot of examples, so let's get started with me, Bob the Developer.

## Conclusion
Now, you understand. What's really going on with super.init, super.viewDidLoad, override, super.property. By now, I hope you understand **why** we use super. Again, I like to use this analogy when it comes to iOS development. Building an app in this ecosystem is like operating a microwave. We definitely need to know how to read manuals which is analogous to being able to read the Swift programming language. To heat up your food, all you have to do is press a couple of buttons and then lights comes off from the side of the wall and the food starts heating up. We don't know exactly how the details work such as particle movements and electromagnetism, but we do know how to operate,  In iOS programming, our job is to learn how to operate and understand why Apple engieers have implemented such features such as Error Handling and Computer Property. Remember this statement,

> Focus on why we use it over why it works. You understand their motives, not the principle behind it because you can't understand why it works. It just works. Microwave jsut works. When you tap on your phone, it just works. Why they did it because it's convenient and easy to use it. Why it works? It's too complicated. I don't know.
