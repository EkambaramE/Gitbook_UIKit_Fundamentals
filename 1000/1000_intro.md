# Part I: Swift 3 Intermediates

## Motivation
Welcome to Part I of The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob. You will learn intermediate Swift concepts which often many courses and books tend to skip due to complexity. However, these concepts are mandatory for you to understand the iOS ecosystem.

I often describe building an app is analogous to writing a book, novel, or any other types. If I don't know how to read and write alphabets, I could still publish that book, but no ones wants to read and except one person: my mom.

I pondered upon why many learners don't have absolute necessary building blocks. Based on answers from hundreds of readers  I've talked to, the primary reason was that instructors lost the ability to relate and to be in the shoes of many students. They considered those concepts to be "obvious" due to their past experience.

In general, I've noticed a lack of empathy in the programming world based on questions and answers I've seen through thousands questions on Stack OverFlow, blog articles, and YouTube tutorials. So, I've decided to step up and set the tone.

## Another Problem
When students learn iOS development for the first time, they get hyped. All they want to do is building apps. Don't get me wrong, I was one of them.

They enroll courses that market, "Take this course to become a full time developer and build 21 apps!". As a formal student who took a dozen of online courses, I've not heard anyone becoming an iOS developer just by taking online courses.

Being a developer is becoming independent. On the other hand, those courses feed you in the mouth. They bring spoons and forks with steamy dumplings. You regurgitate their code like a zombie. It's not about building apps. Creating final products has no meaning if you can't build your own.

## Organization of Part 1
There are four chapters that are the building blocks of the iOS ecosystem. Without a solid understanding of any of them, you will face errors after errors without knowing what to do. Also, you will type 20 lines of code which you can possibly with 5.

### Swift 3 Intermediate Fundamentals
In the first chapter, you will learn most misunderstood and skipped concepts. You will primarily understand why we use these features of the Swift programming language. You must know why before how. This a my favorite quote, "Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how. You will no longer see those red marks on the left side. From now on, You no longer have to guess and check.

### Advanced Object Oriented Programming
Often beginners do not understand what `super` means within `viewDidLoad`. If you are one of them, don't worry. By the end, you will have a greater understanding of Object Oriented Programming that prepares you to become proficient with UIKit objects in Part 2.

> Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS development ecosystem.

### Intro to Functional Programming
This is one of the most dreaded topics for beginner Swift developers. Many don't understand what closures are and how they are similar or different from functions. You are going to learn what Completion Handlers are you will design your own.

### Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming
Protocol Oriented Programming is the rising star in iOS development. In this chapter, you will learn how and why such a paradigm is used and this will prepare for you to apply in Part 2. You will apply POP to create reusable cells and views. Along with Functional Programming, it allows you to write readable and organized code. Also, you are going to learn what delegate truly means in iOS.

## Get Started
I know you are super excited as I'm. I created this course as if I were in your shoes because I still remember those days. That being said, let's learn why and how.
