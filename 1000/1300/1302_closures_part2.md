# Closures vs Functions (Part 2)
## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Functional Programming. In our previous lesson, you've learned how to create a closure. Now, you are going to create a function that both use it as a parameter, and even returns it.

## Conclusion
If you were to take away one thing, please remember this. You can pass closure to an argument label and even return closure. This is the basis of functional programming, which I'm not going to dive into.
