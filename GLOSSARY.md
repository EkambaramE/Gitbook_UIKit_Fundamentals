## Bob the Developer
Bob is such a competitive name on Google. So, I had to differentiate myself.  Not only I enjoy programming, but also building things up including my business and personal brand. As you may realize, Bob is my nickname. When I was in 8th grade, a few American friends couldn't pronounce my Korean name, so they decided to call me Bob. So, here I'm today. 


## SangJoon
SangJoon is my Korean name. I'm a native Korean. It goes like this 상준.
