UIKit Fundamentals with Bob\n\n\n   \n\n\nPurpose\nI've started working on this course for 8 weeks. Since this is my first course,  there has been a number of internal issues and struggles. So far, I've deleted dozens of videos to meet my standard. However, I think I've finally found my way. For those who are new, this course is targeted towards Swift intermediates. To be more specific, it aims at those who've been learning Swift for 3-6 months, and you have an understanding of Objective-Oriented Programming, but you'd like to get used to the iOS ecosystem such as design patterns and practical skills.\nReference\nThis document will be used as the place for my students to download source code, practice problem answers, and all of my lecture notes. I've taken many courses on various platforms, but I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned so that I can always look back. Most instructors do not document because it takes a lot more time than making videos alone. However, I understand I'm the underdog. I have decided to choose this journey to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\nProgress update\nBecause I've gone through many trials and errors to produce courses that would provide as much value for my students, it's been taking a lot longer than I had expected. I hope this documentation would at least give you a progress update in terms of where I'm standing at. You can find out the latest update on the bottom.\nAdvertisement\nThis document will demonstrate the amount of research and preparation it requires to produce a single course. Prospective students might be able to find out how the course is structured by skimming through each section before they decide to purchase.\nLong Term Benefits\nSwift and iOS go through major updates each year. Compared to publishing a new version of a book, releasing a new video course takes up a lot more time due to editing and recording. However, if I organize my notes, practice problems, and scripts into a single basket, it becomes much easier to reproduce videos for future updates.\nVision\nI'd like to devote my career to teaching and helping the world. I'd like to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless wealth, religion, gender, sex, and race. I will continue to document my journey. Teaching iOS is one way for me to get started.\nOnce I get enough of revenue and income through making courses and writing books, I plan to build a company in Silicon Valley and provide unmatchable online education marketplaces for people all around the world. In 2017, there are leading online teaching platforms such as Udemy, Pluralsight, Treehouse, and Udacity. I have a bigger goal such as implementing Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality to teaching and connecting the world.\nI imagine poor kids in Africa/Asia learning how to make robots and practical gadgets for their community through our platform. You can find about my daily journey right here.\nContribution \nIf you've found this document on Github, you may read the entire lecture notes here. If you are interested in registering for this course, send me a quick email briefly introducing yourself at bobleesj@gmail.com. It's going to be free until it is released. As of today (Feb 14th), 220 student have registered so far. I send a weekly update. If you've noticed any issues and  you'd like to review or provide better examples, feel free to help me out. I will credit your work by mentioning your name at the end of this document.\nLicense\nYou are welcome to clone. However, please identify your source.

Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, it doesn't mean it's going to be all those butterflies and rainbows. In fact, you will suffer.\nAlso, I'd like to clearly inform my students that this course isn't just about making apps or portfolio. In fact, you most likely never get a job simply by taking a couple courses on Udemy or other platforms. Being an iOS developer takes of time, energy, and patience. I'd like you to jot down or write down some key points what it takes to become an iOS developer or build your dream app.\nGround Rules\n\nNo excuses. I don’t take complainers: If your English isn’t good, go learn. Go to YouTube, in fact, English is my second language too, and I don’t have a computer science degree. All I did was I went to public libraries and read books and took notes. If I'm able to learn, you are also as well.  You've got amazing resources available online. If you can afford buying either a Mac or iPhone, you have more than plenty of resources to go your own.\nEmbrace Pain. If you aren’t struggling, then you are not learning. It doesn’t mean it can’t be fun. Why do people like to climb the mountain. Fly from the mountain. It’s because of the story, and the hardship makes success so much great. You have to accept that being an iOS developer is a rough path like climbing the mountain. But, you will get paid way more, about 2 times the average of the national income in the US. But you don’t have to become an iOS developer, but it’s always to good to produce your own app and possibly create something that changes and disrupts the world like Uber.\nDream Big. You may argue, more than half of people don’t download apps in a month, and it’s too competitive.But, Steve jobs once said, those who are crazy enough will change the world. Your mindset and vision, you will attain your goal with a bunch of failures.\nLearning is done by you. Before I write a single tutorial or blog articles, I spend quite a number of hours before I do. I learn while doing it, and so should you. When you learn something, make sure create a blog or simply use Medium like me so that I don’t have to worry about hosting. No excuses.\nBe skeptical. Don't trust me all the way. Make sure if you spot some of practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased and I might have bad practices. Challenge the norm and stand out\nDo not listen to Xcode. You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message and paste on Stack Overflow. Ask me questions. Do whatever you can.\n\n\nI mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to give you nets, but you have to use those nets by yourself. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of you. If you can't deal with it, then you are too soft.\n\nYour Ideal Learning Stage\nIt’s okay if you don’t understand the concept right away. However, you must check out resources multiple times besides just mine. If you still don’t get it, go to bed, sleep, and wake up and study again. That’s how I understand how to use closures in Swift 3 and completion handlers.\nNever ever click those red notifications on the left side of Xcode like question mark without knowing what’s going on underneath. You must absolutely understand. What does that mean? You need the fundamental of Swift. Learn how to read Apple Documentation. It’s so important. There are so many classes and functions that come up every iOS update, and the only thing is you watch WWDC ands start using them. Research first before you ask a single question. You must struggle first.\nCourse Design\n1. Personal Story: Every lesson should flow like a story. I will introduce some of pain points in real-life situation and then try to solve with them using Swift.\n2. Application: In order to solve the problem, I will then provide you with examples and introduce new concepts and also apply concepts in real life situation. Lecture: Screen and My Face and. PowerPoints, visual graphics, I continue explaining the concept using the laymen's term.\n3. Practice Problems: You have to solve those problems with yourself. I will have source code available for each problem.\n4. Resources: I've attached plenty of resources for you to study by attaching numerous other articles and YouTube videos if necessary. Including lecture notes.\n5. Independent Studies: By now, you've learned how to catch fish. You may explore more by learning on your own. If you still confused after numerous times of googling, you may ask the question to HipChat. If no one replies to you, try to send me an email. If I'm able to find your answer within the first 5 pages of Google, I will just give you the link.\nYou do the work: Do the challenge problem, think about this learning can be beneficial for your future endeavor or your current life. Don't be like a code monkey who just does the same over and over. Apply. If you are confused, take a look at the resources, if you are still confused, don't ask anyone. but google. Read through the entire firs 10 pages, and if you are still stuck, and then ask on Stack Overflow or Hipchat. You will be surprised how much you learn through the research phase just beyond the things you were confused about.\n"},"0000/0005_Resources.html":{"url":"0000/0005_Resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nTo make your learning process more enjoyable with me, I provide what no other instructors have ever provided. I know this because I studied the market. I took every major online iOS course from every source including Lynda, Treehouse, Udemy, Plusralsite.\nHere are a list of resources that differentiate my course from the rest.\n\nHipChat. Unlike Slack but free for unlimited users. If you don't know HipChat or Slack, it's a group message app. The name of the group is called, iOS Geek Community. Feel free to introduce yourself under the welcome section. I share articles, updates, and so on. You guys can create your own group. Make sure create a private group so that no other can see the group. We don't want to have too many. By creating a private group, you may form a study group and partners to learn together. Who knows you guys might find great partners. You can find the link right here, and download the app and join for free for unlimited users!\nSwift Beginner's Book: If you are not confident with Swift programming language but you are good with Objective-C or other programming langauges, this is a $19.99 book I'm currently selling. Feel free to buy this! Just kidding, I'm giving it for free for you to study. You will be able to learn the basics of Object Orietned Programming although I already expect you to know this by now. This book is in a series.  There's Part 2 and Part 3 for Swift. So feel free to study them if you feel like you want to compare yourself whether you are a good Swift developer.\nEmail list if you'd like to be on my email which I often give out premium content for free such as this course, upcoming courses for Practical Protocol, Functional, and MVVM. You guys can stay up to date with me. Everyone on the email all have sent me emails to on this email list so I treat them with care and I read and reply to all messages even if you send me a word or two. My principle is that I don't collect your email just to spam or for the sake numbers. I believe in quality over quantity. I believe in long term relationships over short-term sales. If you are interested in, shoot me a quick emailing describing who you are, and I will get you on the list!\nLecture Notes: This is truly what separates me from the rest instructors out there. I've made an organized online documentation/ebook. This is my script for the beginning and also the conclusion. Lecture notes, and so on. The reason I do this, I understand Swift has iOS has an update every year. In order to be very first person to market, I need stay organized, and also provide consistent value for my students. The reason for you is that It contains source code which has the answers for all the challenges for each lesson. Also very brief explanation that helps you bring back your memory. It could be used as your reference. You'd be surprised how much research and prep go through for each lesson. But, I'm looking for long term, so this way of documenting everything will help me in the future.\nBlogs: I publish one article per week. This is where everything got started. You will find tons of great content that's not covered in this course such as tips and my biased perspectives!\nJourney: Last, and the least, if you are interested in my personal journey and my daily thought, feel free to read my public diary.\n\n"},"1000/1100/1100_intro.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1100_intro.html","title":"Swift Fundamentals","keywords":"","body":"Swift Fundamentals\nHave you been frustrated by those red marks on the left side of your Xcode?

When I first started programming in Swift just like many of you, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, I bought books and whatever resources I could acquire to learn iOS programming by myself.\nUntil for another month, I never really understood what those ? and ! stood for. Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, you know what I'm talking. I got frustrated. It seemed like no courses gave me clear reasons how to use optionals, and why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Well, today, you are going to learn why fundamentally we use optionals and how to use it with me, Bob the Developer.\nLecture Notes\nImplicit vs Explicit\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\n// Rule: Every variable with normal type must have value associated\nlet hi = \"123\"\n\n// But why?\n\nFetching Profile Picture\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet myNewName: String? = nil\n\nprint(myName)\nprint(myNewName)\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\n\n// robAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nMust Convert Optionals to Normal Type for usage\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nTwo ways to convert/unwrap Optionals to Normal Types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook)\n\nvar image: String = \"\"\n\nimage = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? --> String\n\nprint(image)\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!)\n\n\nForced Unwrapping is not recommended\n\nlet myFacebookName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\n\nvar myCoolName: String = \"\"\n\n// myCoolName = myFacebookName! // nil\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nif let myFacebookName = myFacebookName {\n  print(\"Hi, my name is \\(myFacebookName)\")\n}\n\nPractice Problem\nSource Code\nAnswer Included\nResources\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Lesson12_Optionals YouTube\nThe Complete Guide to Understanding Swift Optionals by Matteo Manferdini PDF\nConclusion\nBoom! Now you finally understand the why Swift engineering have implemented optionals and how to use them. To be more specific, you've learned two fundamental concepts in optionals. The rule number one is that every variable type even if it's optionals type has to be defined whether explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are ways to unwrap optionals to normal values. Force using the ! mark and safe using if let. In our next lesson, you are learning how to apply optionals when you create an object and play around with its properties and methods.

Just to recap, in our previous lesson, you've learned why we optionals, and there are two ways to unwrap. But, have you ever wondered why you see those ? and ! automatically added when you randomly try to get properties and methods in object? If you haven't, that's okay. You will find out. The goal is to prevent you from guessing and checking. Let's find out what's really going under the hood. Let's begin!\nLecture Notes\nExample\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nCreate an Object\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nlet bob = Human(name: \"Bob\")\nbob.name\nbob.sayHello()\n\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name\n\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\n\nSource Code\nResources\nChapter for Object Oriented Programming\nConclusion\nNow, you no longer have to guess when to use ? and ! mark when you are working with objects such as UIKit. Please remember that if you see any ? then make sure you unwrap implicitly. If you have any questions, make sure check out resources and HipChat if you have any questions.\nIn our next lesson, you are learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap and why you use it in the first place instead of using if let.

We are at lesson 3 of Part 1 of Swift fundamentals with Bob. First of all, let me share with you a story of mine first. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an else-if statement. It wasn't a big deal. For example, if something is true, you run this block, if not, else, you run that. However, a guard statement confused the heck out of me. I don't know why. Maybe some of you guys feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. But a guard statement provides a feeling zen which means clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Well, let's find out why.\nLecture Notes\nExample\nCreate an Object\nSource Code\nResources\nConclusion\nBoom, What's going on? How was the lesson just now? I hope you understand the power of using a guard statement that it provides an early exit and you don't have to read all the way to the bottom. You are using a guard statement not because just to please yourself, but also for the sake of your teammate's hair so it doesn't turn grey when he/she is reading your code. Okay, great. In next our lesson, we are going to learn another ! and ? for type casting which allows you to convert types.

I think you might be a little tired of seeing these ! and ? since Lesson 1. However, this is the most confusing concept in Swift, so we had to go over. I just wanted to be on the same as you guys are. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created classes. I don't think I need to talk to much. I will show the example right away. Let's dive into.\nLecture Notes\nSource Code\nResources\nImage of the Structure\nConclusion\nGreat job, if you've understood what type casting is finally. It is somewhat similar to optionals right? You've learn two ways convert types. One is upcasting, as, which always works because you are going up to super class and you getting rid of properties and methods. The other way downlcasting which is become more specific, but as you've seen it may work and may not work. Therefore you use either as?to safely convert or as! to force convert. You are going to find out how type casting is such a beautiful thing when it comes to grouping objets. You will find out in Part 2 of this course. I know you are excited, just bear with me for a second. In our next lesson, we are going to deal with another ? and !. It's going to be the last one, and you will no longer fear those red signs on the left.\nStay Connected\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me at bobleesj@gmail.com.\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html","title":"Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of Part 1: Swift Intermediates with Bob.

I will walk you through, and let's find out!\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the motivation for using Swift Errror Handling snytax such as catch, do, and try instead of writing a else-if statement to handle unexpected outcomes. You've also learned the differences between try, try?, and try!. You can only use try when you use it within a do block. However, if you don't care about catching errors that thrown, you may use try? and try!. But make sure never use ! because it can crash at any time.\nThat's it guys. You've covered the entire ! and ? such as type casting, error handling, optionals, and optional chaning. I'm so proud of how much you've come, and you will find out how these Swift concepts play a major role in Part 2 of the course and of course Part 3.

So make sure, don't use it too often. Somtimes, it might be better for you to use a property or method for clarity. An Apple engineering once said, brevity is not the worthwhile goal.

Before we start using components with UIKit objects such images, buttons, and labels to beautifully design UI for apps, let's take a look what happens to your phone internally when you click on the app icon to get started and terminated. Since this is a course designed for intermediates, I already assume you are familiar Storyboard to design UI. &#x1F600;\nIn our previous chapter, you've learned about how delegate works. Just to recap, the delegate pattern is used to send messages and data. You will now see how delegate works in the overall iOS ecosystem.  So, let's get started. So, make sure you are familiar with delegate before you decide to continue.\nOutline\n\nShow How the Cycle works within the AppDelegate.swift file\nShow the image of the simplified version of the life cycle\nShow the entire cycle: Describe the role of UIApplication\n\nThe Life Cycle of an App\nUIApplicationObject: The UIApplication object manages the event loop and other high-level app behaviors. It also reports key app transitions and some special events (such as incoming push notifications) to its delegate, which is a custom object you define. Use the UIApplication object as is—that is, without subclassing.\n Simplified Version of the Life Cycle\n\nNot running: The app has not been launched or was running but was terminated by the system.\nInactive: The app is running in the foreground but is currently not receiving events due to phone calls or other external events.\nActive: The app is running in the foreground and is receiving events. This is the normal mode for foreground apps.\nBackground: The app is in the background and executing code. Most apps enter this state briefly on their way to being suspended.\nSuspended: The app is in the background but is not executing code. The system moves apps to this state automatically and does not notify them before doing so. While suspended, an app remains in memory but does not execute any code. When a low-memory condition occurs, the system may purge suspended apps without notice to make more space for the foreground app.\n\nUIApplication Delegate Method\nMost state transitions are accompanied by a corresponding call to the methods of your app delegate object. These methods are your chance to respond to state changes in an appropriate way. These methods are listed below, along with a summary of how you might use them.\n\napplication:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:—This method is your app’s first chance to execute code at launch time.\n\nThis method is called after your app has been launched and its main storyboard or nib file has been loaded, but before your app’s state has been restored. At the time this method is called, your app is in the inactive state.\n\napplication:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:—This method allows you to perform any final initialization before your app is displayed to the user.\napplicationDidBecomeActive:—Lets your app know that it is about to become the foreground app. Use this method for any last minute preparation.\napplicationWillResignActive:—Lets you know that your app is transitioning away from being the foreground app. Use this method to put your app into a quiescent state\napplicationDidEnterBackground:—Method called when the app moves from foreground to background\napplicationWillEnterForeground:—Method called when the app moves from background to foreground\napplicationWillTerminate:— Method called when the app gets killed\nFor app initialization, it is highly recommended that you use this method and the application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method and do not use the applicationDidFinishLaunching: method, which is intended only for apps that run on older versions of iOS. Apple\n\n\n\n The entire life cycle of an app\nWhat's main()?\nUIKit written in Objective-C and comes from C language in order to start, there is main function and iOS is based on Unix. It's like you have to insert your key to your car to drive.\nUIApplicationMain\nThis function is called in the main entry point to create the application object and the application delegate and set up the event cycle\nThe app delegate is the standard delegate for built-in application object, it works with the UIApplication object to handle application-level events like initialization and state transitions.\nThe UIApplication object is responsible for handling communication between our code and Apple system frameworks.\nThe app delegate create a UIWindow object as well as a view controller. UIWindow is responsible for coordinating the presentation of one or more views on screen.\nEvents are queued internally by the app and dispatched one-by-one to the main run loop for execution.\nThe UIApplication object is the first object to receive the event and make the decision about what needs to be done.\nThe Role of objects in an iOS app\n\nUIApplication: The UIApplication object manages the event loop and other high-level app behaviors. It also reports key app transitions and some special events (such as incoming push notifications) to its delegate, which is a custom object you define. Use the UIApplication object as is—that is, without subclassing.\nApp delegate object: The app delegate is the heart of your custom code. This object works in tandem with the UIApplication object to handle app initialization, state transitions, and many high-level app events. This object is also the only one guaranteed to be present in every app, so it is often used to set up the app’s initial data structures.\nView Controller Objects: It provides default functionality for loading views, presenting them, rotating them in response to device rotations, and several other standard system behaviors. UIKit and other frameworks define additional view controller classes to implement standard system interfaces such as the image picker, tab bar interface, and navigation interface.\nUIWindow Object: A UIWindow object coordinates the presentation of one or more views on a screen. Most apps have only one window, which presents content on the main screen\nView objects, control objects, layout objects: Views and controls provide the visual representation of your app's content. A view is an object that draws content in designated area and responds to events within that area. Controls are a specialized type of view responsible for implementing familiar interface objects such as buttons, text fields, and toggle switches.\n\nWhat's State Restoration?\n\nRestores your app where the user left it\nMakes your app appear as if they never terminated\nUsers seamlessly get back to where they were at\n\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned what happens internally when you launch your app. You've also learned how delegate is such an important design pattern.\nIn out next lessons, you are going to learn what viewDidLoad truly means in iOS, where it happens during the life cycle. Stay tuned.
