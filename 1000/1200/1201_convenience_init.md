# Convenience Init

## Introduction
Welcome to the first lesson of The UIKit Fundamentals Part 1 Chapter 2 Advanced Object Oriented Programming.

In this lesson, you will learn. How to become lazy, or in other words, become smart when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable. Bill Gates once said, Whenever there is hard work to be done, I assign it to the laziest man as he is sure to find an easy way of doing it. Be Lazy. Think Crazy!" Let's get started.

## Conclusion
What do you think? You've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time. Imagine you are creating a library or a group of code for your teammates to use. Your teammate no longer has to use a designated init method initialize an object. It's a win-win situation. In our next lesson, let's talk about whether initialization might fail. Take care, and keep developing your skills and mind.
