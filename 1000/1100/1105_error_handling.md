# Error Handling

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 5 of Part 1: Swift Intermediates with Bob. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to write modular and more explicit code to indicate a possible error message instead of using a bloated, thick `else-if` statement. If you are confused, that's alright. I will walk you through, and let's find out!

## Conclusion
In this lesson, you've learned the motivation for using Swift Errror Handling snytax such as `catch`, `do`, and `try` instead of writing a `else-if` statement to handle unexpected outcomes. You've also learned the differences between `try`, `try?`, and `try!`. You can only use `try` when you use it within a `do` block. However, if you don't care about catching errors that thrown, you may use `try?` and `try!`. But make sure never use `!` because it can crash at any time.

That's it guys. You've covered the entire `!` and `?` such as type casting, error handling, optionals, and optional chaning. I'm so proud of how much you've come, and you will find out how these Swift concepts play a major role in Part 2 of the course and of course Part 3. In our next lesson, we are learn how make ourselves dry. In other words, we are going to prevent us from repeating our code. See you soon!
