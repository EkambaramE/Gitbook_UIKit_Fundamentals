# Completion Handlers

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 4 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Functional Programming. This is the last lesson. But, this is the important lesson we will talk about in this course. You will definitely see a lot of completion handler blocks when it comes to using APIs such as getting images from Facebook, Instagram, and so on. You will learn what completion handlers is and why we use it in the first place. Enough of said, let's get into the meat and potatoes. However, again, learning completion handlers is challenging. It took weeks for me understand. I could have done an extraordinary job in explaining, but I still expect you feel uncomfortable. Don't worry. We will dive more in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course.
