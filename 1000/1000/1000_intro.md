# Part I: Swift 3 Intermediates

## Motivation
Welcome to Part One of The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob. You will learn intermediate Swift concepts which often many courses and books tend to skip due to complexity. However, these concepts are mandatory for you to understand the entire iOS ecosystem.

I'd like describe making an iOS app is like creative works such as you can write novels, poems, songs, and so forth. However, if you don't know how to read and write alphabets and grammar, you will face roadblocks, big ones.


Often times, students get lost because instructors perceive these concepts to be "obvious" largely due to their past experience in iOS development. They've lost the ability to relate with new students. I don't want to be one of those. I have been in school for the last 12 years in a row, and I understand your position.

In order to prevent any miscommunication between you and me, I've designed this course to be detailed so that we are all on the same page.


## Why Fundamentals
Often times, when students learn iOS development for the first time, they get hyped, and all they want to do is building apps. However, as I mentioned, you have to know the alphabets and rules that fundamentally make those pieces.

Have you heard, "Take this course to become a full time developer and build 21 apps!". As a formal student, I've taken and read many. However, I've soon found it's not just building apps. It's about becoming self sustainable. In other words, courses must teach how to catch fish instead of feeding by letting them copy off from the screen when they even don't understand what's going on.

For me, when I first took one of those courses, I had no idea what those question marks, and exclamation marks stood for. I never understood what it means by `override` and `super`.

This course is not about builing apps. This course is about making you a sustainable developer so that once you have all these tools such as cement, glue, concrete, you can build an empire of your own. In Part 1, you are going to learn how those tools are made up of. In Part 2, you are going to learn how to use those tools. In Part 3, you are going to learn how to build empires using those tools. Many courses tend to skip to Part 3 right away by telling them, "Learn by Doing". It doesn't work well if a student is new to the ecosystem. For example, when you travel to a new country, you don't want to learn while you are trying to book a train ticket in Chinese for example. You make sure want to know what Chinese is like, how it feels and looks like first. Of course, I'm also going to apply "learn by doing" method, but I'd like to build a strong foundation first.



## Organization of Part 1
There are four chapters that are the building blocks of the iOS ecosystem. Without an understanding these concepts in Swift, you will never be able to build apps without getting errors.

### Swift 3 Fundamentals
In this lesson, you will learn the most commonly misunderstood and skipped concepts when beginners learn how to make apps for the first time. You will primarily understand why you see those error messages on the left side of Playground or Xcode. You will never guess. In fact, you are less likely to see those problems since you know what to do.
* [Optionals](1000/1100//1101_optionals.md)
* [Optionals Chaining](1000/1100/1102_optionals_chaining.md)
* [Guard Statements](1000/1100/1103_guard_statements.md)
* [Type Casting](1000/1100/1104_type_casting.md)
* [Error Handling](1000/1100/1105_error_handling.md)
* [Generics](1000/1100/1106_generics.md)
* [Subscripts](1000/1100/1107_subscripts.md)
* [Class vs Struct](1000/1100/1108_class_vs_struct.md)
* [Typealias](1000/1100/1109_typealias.md)


### Advanced Object Oriented Programming
Often beginners don't even know what `super` means under `viewDidLoad`. If you are one of them, don't worry. I was too for 3 months .You have a greater understanding of Object Oriented Programming so that there is no issue you will encounter when dealing with objects in UIKits.

* [Advanced OOP](1000/1200/1200_intro.md)
* [Convenience Init](1000/1200/1201_convenience_init.md)

* [Computed Property](1000/1200/1203_computed_property.md)
* [Override Init/Method](1000/1200/1204_override_init_method.md)
* [Two Phase Init](1000/1200/1205_two_phase_init.md)
* [Property Observer](1000/1200/1206_property_observer.md)
* [Type Property and Method](1000/1200/1207_type_property_method.md)

### Functional Programming
This is one of the most dreaded topic for beginner Swift developers. Many don't understand what closures are and how they are similar or different from functions. You are going to learn what Completion Handlers are and you will design your own. I will also introduce to functional programming and talk about their advantages compared to traditional ways to solve a problem. This topic could be the most challenging for many, and it's most likely be.

* [Closures vs Functions](1000/1300/1301_closures_vs_functions.md)
* [Closures (Part 2)](1000/1300/1302_closures_part2.md)
* [Trailing Closures](1000/1300/1303_trailing_closures.md)
* [Completion Handlers](1000/1300/1304_completion_handlers.md)
* [Filter, Reduce, and Map](1000/1300/1305_filter_reduce_map.md)
* [Filter, Reduce, and Map (Part 2)](1000/1300/1306_filter_reduce_map_part2.md)
* [@escape and @autoclosures](1000/1300/1307_@escape_@autoclosures.md)

### Protocol Oriented Programming
Protocol Oriented Programming is the rising star in iOS development. In this chapter, you will learn how and why such a paradigm is used and this will prepare for you to apply in Part 2 which is primarily for UIKits. Along with Functional Programming, it allows you to write readable and organized code. Also, you are going to learn what delegate truly means in iOS.

* [Protocol Oriented Programming](1000/1400/1400_intro.md)
* [Introduction to Protocol](1000/1400/1401_intro_to_protocol.md)
* [Protocol Extension](1000/1400/1402_protocol_extension.md)
* [Protocol as Type](1000/1400/1403_protocol_as_type.md)
* [Delegate](1000/1400/1404_delegate.md)

## Get Started
I know you are super excited as I'm. I've deleted dozens of videos and outlines to create this course, and this course has been delayed more than 2 months in order to meet my standard. I created this course as if I were in your shoes and learning iOS development. That being said, I've minimized flawed based on my eyes, but I'm sure there will be better ways. But, let's learn with me.
