# Delegate

## Introduction
Welcome to the last lesson of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming. Today, you learn the most important concept. It is not technically about protocol oriented programming. You use Protocol, but you will learn how to pass data between two classes using it. There are a lot of bullshit tutorials out there. You've come to the right place. Let me tell you the majority of people don't understand what's going on, and they simply copy off from the screen. Have you ever seen, tableView.delegate = self? What the heck is that?

## Conclusion
Great, how was it guys? For those who are confused, you might have to watch this video 5-10 times to get used to it. You might have to search up on Google and learn more. You might have to playaround. If you are confused by my lesson and you are not getting it, it's your fault. It took me 2 weeks to understand delegate. It's not easy. But, you just have to struggle when you are not in the comfort zone.  Struggle is virtue.
