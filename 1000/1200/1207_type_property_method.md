# Type Property

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 7, the last lesson of The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob, Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. Today, you are going to learn one of the most confused topics when it comes to Object Oriented Programming and type methods and properties. If you aren't with this, don't you worry my friend. You might a bit confused, but you will come out strong, confident, and pumped. You will be excited to apply what you will learn today in your code later. Enough of talking. Let's go!

## Conclusion
Remember a couple things. First, if you use `final` or `static`, that means you can inherit, but you can not override. Second, when you are using `class property`, you have to use computed property for some reason I couldn't find out. Third, if you've learned something, let me see. Good for you. Keep developing, and you will see how everything fits together like the human digestive system.
