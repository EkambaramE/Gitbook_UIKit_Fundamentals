## Conclusion
How was this chapter for you? Confusing? Uncomfortable? Annoying? Distressed? I understand. What we covered so far took me more than 2 months to understand since I started learning with Swift, especially with Completion Handlers. It took me ages. Probably not many books and courses talk about how to create one. But, remember we haven't really used much with closures to become a functional programmer. I'm currently making a course that implements functional programming, protocol oriented programming, MVVM, and RxSwift. If you are interested in getting updates from me, feel free to send me an email to reserve you spot! In our next chapter, we are going to learn one of the most beautiful concepts in the Swift Programming language. I fell in love with it. Let's learn Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming.
