## Problem
-  Have you seen those red marks on the left side of Xcode but you don't know how to deal with them?
-  Have you taken numerous courses and books, but you weren't able to create you own app, and you don't feel confident to share your code with someone else?
- Have you ever felt you've been copying off from the screen like a code monkey without understanding what's going on?

I ask because I have. As a developer who started with Swift as my first programming, I've gone through the pains and struggles you have. I had no idea what was going on, such as `delegate = self`, `get`,  `set`,   and completion handlers. And the instructors kept going lessons after lessons without much resources available. I got massively confused which design patterns to follow and so on.

As a blogger and instructor, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've read hundreds of questions asking, "Bob, how can I write better code?", Out of frustration that there isn't enough intermediate resources available in a single basket, I decided to create this course for my younger self, and of course, for you.

This course isn't about making 18 apps to become a paid developer. This course is about learning how to become independent on your own. Perhaps, If you really want to just make apps, why not just download from Github. In this course, we do not care about final products. We care about learning and process and progress. Because if you know how to use tools, you can build any.

## Introduction
I'm Bob, also known as Bob the Developer. I run one of the fastest growing blogs called, `iOS Geek Community` with over thousands of daily visitors and near million views from students and iOS developers all around the world.

Before I talk about what's inside of this course, I'd like to address why trust me, and so that you don't waste your money, and most importantly, your time. I'm all about building long term relationships with my students. Had I not followed this principle, it would've been impossible for my work to get any traction. I care about my reputation and personal brand more than anyone. As a result, quality matters to me. I've conducted surveys with over hundred readers of mine, and I've put everything together in this course.

## Course Structure
This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, you will learn intermediate Swift fundamentals. You will learn topics I struggled the most such as Optionals, Type Casting, Optional Chaining, Then you will learn advanced Objet Oriented Programming: Property Observer, Convenience init, Two phase init,  meaning of super.  Then, Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming such as delegate. Intro to Functional Programming: designing completion handlers, and closures.

 In Part 2, you will understand the overview of the iOS ecosystem including the life cylce of an app and view, UIKit Components such as Autolayout, protocol-oriented UITableView, UICollectionView which make a lot of reusable code. For the most time, you will build apps programmatically that increases productivity and control of your app. You will use best design patterns and architecture that I've researched and practiced and learned for a year with Swift.

 Lastly, in Part 3, you will create real app so that what you've learned in Part 1 and Part 2. Instead of using core-data, we will use modern database, called, Realm and real-data sync through cloud computing provided by Ocean World

## Call to Action
What differentiate myself from the rest is that I provide great resources along with lecture notes and dozens of supporting articles and YouTube videos which I have been working on for the last 5 months before I decided to provide premium content. Also there is a place for you to chat and ask questions when stuck. This course will be only $50 and I will not provide any discount because I believe I provide enough value for my students. I believe in quality over quantity.

If you are from third world countries and it puts too much of financial burden on you, feel free to send me an email. I will be more than happy to help you out. I grew up in those countries so I understand it's not right to charge everyone the same despite unequal purchasing  power.

 If you to learn and grow together, I welcome you to join me and our exciting journey. See you soon.
