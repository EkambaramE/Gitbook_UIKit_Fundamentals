# Property Observer

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 6 of The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob, Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. You are going to learn how to put a tracker to a property. For example, never mind. Let's just do it.

## Lecture Notes
### Problem
How can I add observer/tracker to a property?

### willSet and didSet
  1. `willSet` is called just before the value is set
  2. `didSet` is called immediately after the new value is set.

### Create Step Counter
Create a variable called, `totalSteps`. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed. In the `willSet` block, `newTotalSteps` refers to the new value stored. In the `didSet` block, `oldValue` refers to the previous value before `totalSteps` encounters a new value.

```swift
var totalSteps: Int = 20 {
 willSet(newTotalSteps) {
   print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
 }
 didSet {
   if totalSteps > oldValue  {
     print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
   }
 }
}

totalSteps = 100  
// About to set totalSteps to 100
// Added 80 steps
```
### Real Life Application
You may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the apps.

```swift
var userLoggedIn: Bool = false {
 willSet(newValue) {
   print("The user has tried something")
 }
 didSet {
   if userLoggedIn {
     print("The user switched from \(oldValue) to \(userLoggedIn)")
   }
 }
}

userLoggedIn = false
// "The user has tried something"
userLoggedIn = true
// "The user has tried something"
// "The user switched from false to true"
```

## Conclusion
Great! The whole purpose of using property observer is to write less code but provide greater readability. You don't have to create a function with a switch or else-if statement. As you've seen there are ways ways to check whether user has been logged or not, computed property for me works great because it provides a separate block of code with distinct keywords such as `didSet` and `willSet`.
