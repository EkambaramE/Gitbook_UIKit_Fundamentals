### Value Proposition
- I admit this course isn't about making 18 apps to become a paid developer. This course is about learning how to catch fish so that you can build your on your own.
-  Have you been seeing those red marks on the left side of Xcode but you don't know why you have the particular problems?
-  Have you experienced that you took courses but it was really difficult to make your own? You've realized that you've been only copying off from the screen like a code monkey?
- Because I have. I started off learning iOS development, just like you. All I wanted to do was build my own app, but I discovered it's not building. It's about understanding the fundamentals.
- If you've never completed your courses before because you were confused in the middle, you've come to the right place.

### Credentials:
- Hi, my name is Bob, I'm from South Korea. I'm the fastest growing iOS blogger over 10,000 followers just in 3 months. My tutorials and articles have been read and viewed over a quarter of million times by students and iOS developers from all around the world.
- Even before I launched this course, over hundreds of people sent me private emails. Because they understand value that I could bring for them.

### Course Structure
 - The course is
 - Imagine building an app is building an empire and castle.
 - Part 1 all about learning how to those bricks, cement, and glues. This course is not for beginners. You've been around at least 3-6 months but you don't know really know the specifics. We are not going over the basics. I already assume you are familiar with Swift programming and played around with Xcode at least a couple weeks.
 - Part 2 is all about learning how to use those cement an tools and focus on UIKit components. How does delegate pattern fit in UITextField, UICollectionView. What does it mean by table.delegate = self
 - Part 3 is all about building real apps with firebase so that you store in the server.

 - Struggling financially, you can't afford $50, let me know I will try to help you out.
 - Being an iOS developer is tough. This course is not for everybody. and this course isn't about being an iOS developer. I could call myself as the CEO, the founder of my business. It doesn't mean anything. What really truly matters is how much you understand how you know. This course isn't about making apps. It's about how you can become a sustainable iOS developer so that you know how to catch fish and instead eating fish like making 18 apps by some other instructors.
 - I expect you to have 3 - 6 months of Swift programming language. You may start off with my YouTube channel to learn Swift.
 - I'm not going to compromise on price. A lot of course, are sold at $10 with $200 course. However, I've decided this isn't the way to go about. I don't to dilute my premium brand as Bob the Developer
 - I'm not going to lower the price.
 - Fundamentally miss out on various platforms.
 - Admit that Im' 20: A lot of fun with me.
 - I consider myself like a coach. It create great students. The greatest athlete never makes a championship team, but great coaches do. I bring people up.
