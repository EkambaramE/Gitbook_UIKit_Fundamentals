UIKit Fundamentals with Bob\n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nAs a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\nReference\nThis is a platform for my students to download source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less travelled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who've lived in third world countries and attended college in NYC, I understand, education, not a degree, is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand. In the future, l hope to create a learning marketplace for people to attain knowledge through VR/AR. I'm here to build relationships with my students and fulfill my purpose. I, Bob the Developer, would like to contribute building people up.\nContribution \nIf you've found this document on Github, you may read the entire lecture notes here. If you are interested in registering for this course, shoot me an email briefly introducing yourself at bobleesj@gmail.com. I will send you a form you to register your spot for free until its release date which is unknown. As of today (March 2nd), 240 students have sent me one. If you'd like to stay up-to-date with the progress, feel free to follow me on Instagram\nLast Update: Sun Mar 05 2017 15:15:07 GMT+0900 (KST)\n"},"0000/promo_video.html":{"url":"0000/promo_video.html","title":"Promotional Video","keywords":"","body":"Promotional Video\nProblem\n\nHave you seen those red marks on the left side of Xcode but you don't know how to deal with them?\nHave you taken numerous courses and books, but you weren't able to create you own app and you feel like you are not writing good code?\nHave you ever felt you've been copying off from the screen like a code monkey without understanding what's going on?\n\nI ask because I have. As a developer who started with Swift as my first programming, I've gone through pains and struggles you have. I had no idea what was going on, such as delegate = self, get,  set,   and completion handlers. And the instructors kept going lessons after lessons without much resources available. I got massively confused which design patterns to follow and so on.\nAs a blogger and instructor, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've read hundreds of questions asking, \"Bob, how can I write better code?\", Out of frustration that there isn't enough intermediate resources available, I decided to create this course for my younger self, and of course, for you.\nThis course isn't about making 18 apps to become a paid developer. This course is about learning how to become independent on your own. Perhaps, If you really want to just make apps, why not just download from Github. In this course, we do not care about final products. We care about learning and process and progress. Because if you know how to use tools, you can build any.\nIntroduction\nI'm Bob, also known as Bob the Developer. I run one of the fastest growing blogs called, iOS Geek Community with over thousands of daily visitors and near million views from students and iOS developers more than hundred countries.\nBefore I talk about what's inside of this course, I'd like to address why trust me, and so that you don't waste your money, and most importantly, your time. I'm all about building long term relationships with my students. Had I not followed this principle, it would've been impossible for my work to get any traction. I care about my reputation and personal brand more than anyone.\nAlso before I launch this course, hundreds of people sent me private emails to register for this course.  They understand my style of teaching with the Laymen's terms, analogy, and humor as well.\nCourse Structure\nSo, let's what we are learning? First, this course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, you will learn intermediate Swift fundamentals. You will learn topics I struggled the most with such as Optionals, Type Casting, Optional Chaining, Then you will learn advanced Objet Oriented Programming: Property Observer, Convenience init, Two phase init,  meaning of super.  Then, Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming such as delegate. Intro to Functional Programming: designing completion handlers, and closures.\nIn Part 2, you will understand the overview of the iOS ecosystem including the life cylce of an app and view, UIKit Components such as Autolayout, UITableView, UICollectionView. The fact, you will how design modular and a lot of protocol oriented programming to write reusable code. So, we do not duplicate. You will learn how to read the API documentation so that you don't have to memorize.\nYou will see what we learned in Part 1 all fits together in Part 2 such as delegate patterns. Lastly, in Part 3, you will create an real app so that what you've learned in Part 1 and Part 2 all come together. We will be using APIs and networking and storing data virtually. You will learn a note taking app as well as a weather app. Remember it's not about building apps, but you will learn..\nBuilding an app is analogous to building a castle. In Part 1, you will learn how to use cements, bricks, and glues. In Part 2, you will learn how to create beds, tables, and doors. In Part 3, you will build a castle as a whole. If you lack Part 1 and 2, it doesn't matter what you build.\nCall to Action\nYou've been around at least 3-6 months but you don't know really know the specifics. We are not going over the basics. I already assume you are familiar with Swift programming and played around with Xcode at least a couple weeks. What differentiate myself from the rest.  Complete Lecture notes with source.  Dozens of supporting articles and YouTube videos which I have been working on for the last 5 months for you. A place for you to chat and ask questions when stuck. So what are you waiting for? This course will be only $50 and I will not provide any discount. However, if you have a financial issue, feel free to send me an email describing your situation. I will be more than happy to help you out. Let's go. I'm super excited to have you here.\n"},"0000/course_overview.html":{"url":"0000/course_overview.html","title":"Course Overview","keywords":"","body":"Course Overview\nThe course is divided into three parts.\n\nThe goal is of course is to become independent\n\nPart 1: Swift Intermediates\n\nPurpose: Learn what the tool is made up of.\n\nChapter 1: Swift Intermediate Fundamentals\nChapter 2: Advanced Object Oriented Programming\nChapter 3: Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming\nChapter 4: Intro to Functional Programming\nPart 2: UIKit Components\n\nGoal: Learn how to use tools\n\nChapter 1: Understanding the iOS ecosystem\n\nLife Cycle of an App\nViewController Structures and View Life Cycle\nPass Data between View Controller with Delegate\nPass Data using NSNotification\nAccess Control\n\nChapter 2: Introduction to Foundational UIs\n\nUIStoryboard Tips\nUINavigation and Tabs and UITableView\nAuto Layout\n\nChapter 3: UIKit Components\n\nUITextField and Delegate\nUIView: Animation\nUIButton, UITextField, UILabel\nUIAlertViewController\nNSUserDefaults (Storage)\n\nChapter 4: UITableView,  UICollectionView\n\nProtocol Oriented\nNetworking: Delete and Swipe.

Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, it doesn't mean it's going to be all those butterflies and rainbows. In fact, you will suffer, and I expect.\nAgain, I'd like to emphasize that this course isn't just about making apps or portfolio. Being an iOS developer takes of time, energy, and patience. Instead, the course focuses on great design patterns, architecture. No more massive view controller. We will learn how to modularize with best practices that i know of.\nGround Rules\n\nNo excuses. I don’t take complainers: If your English isn’t good, go learn. Go to YouTube, in fact, English is my second language too, and I don’t have a computer science degree. All I did was I went to public libraries and read books and took notes. If I'm able to learn, you are also as well.  You've got amazing resources available online. If you can afford buying either a Mac or iPhone, you have more than plenty of resources to go your own.\nEmbrace Pain. If you aren’t struggling, then you are not learning. It doesn’t mean it can’t be fun. Why do people like to climb the mountain. Fly from the mountain. It’s because of the story, and the hardship makes success so much great. You have to accept that being an iOS developer is a rough path like climbing the mountain. But, you will get paid way more, about 2 times the average of the national income in the US. But you don’t have to become an iOS developer, but it’s always to good to produce your own app and possibly create something that changes and disrupts the world like Uber.\nDream Big. You may argue, more than half of people don’t download apps in a month, and it’s too competitive.But, Steve jobs once said, those who are crazy enough will change the world. Your mindset and vision, you will attain your goal with a bunch of failures.\nLearning is done by you. Before I write a single tutorial or blog articles, I spend quite a number of hours before I do. I learn while doing it, and so should you. When you learn something, make sure create a blog or simply use Medium like me so that I don’t have to worry about hosting. No excuses. Gitbook, always document.\nBe skeptical. Don't trust me all the way. Make sure if you spot some of practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased and I might have bad practices. Challenge the norm and stand out\nDo not listen to Xcode. You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message and paste on Stack Overflow. Ask me questions. Do whatever you can.\nAlways expect to review. Learning is done by you. I was thinking of giving you practice problems, but we are not being tested on anything. It's your job to figure out how what you've learned can be applied to somewhere else.\n\nIf you really know the fundamentals, you may apply to anywhere else.\n\nI mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to give you nets, but you have to use those nets by yourself. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of you. If you can't deal with it, then you are too soft.\n\nYour Ideal Learning Stage\nIt’s okay if you don’t understand the concept right away. However, you must check out resources multiple times besides just mine. If you still don’t get it, go to bed, sleep, and wake up and study again. That’s how I understand how to use closures in Swift 3 and completion handlers.\nNever ever click those red notifications on the left side of Xcode like question mark without knowing what’s going on underneath. You must absolutely understand. What does that mean? You need the fundamental of Swift. Learn how to read Apple Documentation. It’s so important. There are so many classes and functions that come up every iOS update, and the only thing is you watch WWDC ands start using them. Research first before you ask a single question. You must struggle first.\nCourse Design\n1. Personal Story: Every lesson should flow like a story. I will introduce some of pain points in real-life situation and then try to solve with them using Swift.\n2. Application: In order to solve the problem, I will then provide you with examples and introduce new concepts and also apply concepts in real life situation. Lecture: Screen and My Face and. PowerPoints, visual graphics, I continue explaining the concept using the laymen's term.\n3. Resources: I've attached plenty of resources for you to study by attaching numerous other articles and YouTube videos if necessary. Including lecture notes.\n4. Independent Studies: By now, you've learned how to catch fish. You may explore more by learning on your own. If you still confused after numerous times of googling, you may ask the question to HipChat. If no one replies to you, try to send me an email. If I'm able to find your answer within the first 5 pages of Google, I will just give you the link.\nYou do the work: Do the challenge problem, think about this learning can be beneficial for your future endeavor or your current life. Don't be like a code monkey who just does the same over and over. Apply. If you are confused, take a look at the resources, if you are still confused, don't ask anyone. but google. Read through the entire firs 10 pages, and if you are still stuck, and then ask on Stack Overflow or Hipchat. You will be surprised how much you learn through the research phase just beyond the things you were confused about.\nLastly, I highly recommend you read an article I wrote, \"How to become an iOS Developer, Bob\". If you are interested in knowing more about my perspective on becoming a better developer.\n"},"0000/resources.html":{"url":"0000/resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nHere are a list of resources that differentiate my course from the rest. I really want you to learn because I care about long-term relationships with my students.\n\nLecture Notes: This is truly what separates me from the rest instructors out there. I've made an organized online documentation/ebook. This is my script for the beginning and also the conclusion. Lecture notes, and so on. The reason I do this, I understand Swift has iOS has an update every year. In order to be very first person to market, I need stay organized, and also provide consistent value for my students. The reason for you is that It contains source code which has the answers for all the challenges for each lesson. Also very brief explanation that helps you bring back your memory. It could be used as your reference. You'd be surprised how much research and prep go through for each lesson. But, I'm looking for long term, so this way of documenting everything will help me in the future.\nGroup Chat. Unlike Slack but free for unlimited users. If you don't know, it's a group message for gamers. The name of the group is called, iOS Geek Community. Feel free to introduce yourself under the welcome section. I share articles, updates, and so on. You guys can create your own group.  You may send highlighted syntax and help each other. Here is the link for you to join the group chat. It's 24/7 free.\nAdditional Tutorials: I publish one article per week. This is where everything got started. You will find tons of great content that's not covered in this course such as tips and my biased perspectives.\nSocial Media: Update, find updates, ask questions. So on.\nEmail list if you'd like to be on my email which I often give out premium content for free such as this course, upcoming courses for Practical Protocol, Functional, and MVVM. You guys can stay up to date with me. Everyone on the email all have sent me emails to on this email list so I treat them with care and I read and reply to all messages even if you send me a word or two. My principle is that I don't collect your email just to spam or for the sake numbers. I believe in quality over quantity. I believe in long term relationships over short-term sales.

You will learn intermediate Swift concepts which often many courses and books tend to skip due to complexity. However, these concepts are mandatory for you to understand the entire iOS ecosystem.\nI'd like describe making an iOS app is like creative works such as you can write novels, poems, songs, and so forth. However, if you don't know how to read and write alphabets and grammar, you will make terrible books. You can still publish that books.\nOften times, students get lost because instructors perceive these intermediate concepts to be \"obvious\" largely due to their past experience in iOS development. Many have lost the ability to relate with new students, a lack of empathy. I don't want to be one of those. I have been a student in school for the last 13 years in a row and I absolutely how it feels to learn something new.\nThe Real Problem\nHere is the real problem. Often times, when students learn iOS development for the first time, they get hyped, and all they want to do is building apps. So what happens is they start taking courses that market themselves as, \"Take this course to become a full time developer and build 21 apps!\". As a formal student learning Swift, I've taken and read many. However, I've soon found it's not just building apps. It's about becoming a self sustainable developer. Do you think you can replicate those apps on your own without copying from the screen like a code monkey?  In other words, courses must teach how to catch fish instead of feeding by them without knowing what they are eating. So, let's get started with the intermediate fundamentals.\nOrganization of Part 1\nThere are four chapters that are the building blocks of the iOS ecosystem. Without an understanding these concepts in Swift, you will never be able to build apps without getting errors and not knowing what to do.\nSwift 3 Intermediate Fundamentals\nOut of four chapters, in the first, you will learn the most commonly misunderstood and skipped concepts when beginners learn how to make apps for the first time. You will primarily understand why we use these features of Swift and how to use fix and prevent error messages on the left side of Playground or Xcode. From now on, You no longer have to guess and check.\n\nOptionals\nOptionals Chaining\nGuard Statements\nType Casting\nError Handling\nGenerics\nSubscripts\nClass vs Struct\nTypealias\n\nAdvanced Object Oriented Programming\nIn the second chapter, it's all about Object Oriented Programming. Often beginners don't even know what super means under viewDidLoad. If you are one of them, don't worry. You have a greater understanding of Object Oriented Programming that prepares you to become proficient with UIKit objects in Part 2 of this course. Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS development ecosystem.\n\nAdvanced OOP\nConvenience Init\nFailable Init\nComputed Property\nOverride Init/Method\nTwo Phase Init\nProperty Observer\nType Property and Method\n\nIntro to Functional Programming\nThis is one of the most dreaded topic for beginner Swift developers. Many don't understand what closures are and how they are similar or different from functions. You are going to learn what Completion Handlers are and you will design your own.\n\nClosures vs Functions\nClosures (Part 2)\nTrailing Closures\nCompletion Handlers\n\nIntro to Protocol Oriented Programming\nProtocol Oriented Programming is the rising star in iOS development. In this chapter, you will learn how and why such a paradigm is used and this will prepare for you to apply in Part 2 which is primarily for UIKits. Along with Functional Programming, it allows you to write readable and organized code. Also, you are going to learn what delegate truly means in iOS.\n\nProtocol Oriented Programming\nIntroduction to Protocol\nProtocol Extension\nProtocol as Type\nDelegate\n\nGet Started\nI know you are super excited as I'm. I've deleted dozens of videos and outlines to create this course, and this course has been delayed to meet my standard. I created this course as if I were in your shoes. That being said, enough of talk, let's dive in!\nResources\nYou can take a look at why I fell in love with Swift\n"},"1000/1100/1100_intro.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1100_intro.html","title":"Swift Fundamentals","keywords":"","body":"Intermediate Swift 3 Fundamentals\nHave you been frustrated by those red marks on the left side of your Xcode?

By the way, I already expect you to know what a for-in loop is and what it means to create an object with classes and structs.\nYou might have used these concepts below; however, you will find out why exactly we use these features over another in Swift.

When I first started programming in Swift just like many of you, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, I bought books and whatever resources I could acquire to learn iOS programming by myself.\nUntil for another month, I never really understood what those ? and ! stood for. Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, you know what I'm talking. I got frustrated. It seemed like no courses gave me clear reasons how to use optionals, and why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Well, today, you are going to learn why fundamentally we use optionals and how to use it with me, Bob the Developer.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRule\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe Type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value or nil.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptional type allows storing nil.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet myNewName: String? = nil\n\nprint(myName)\nprint(myNewName)\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nMust Convert Optionals to Normal Type for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\n// robAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap Optionals to Normal Types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\nForced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if an optional contains nil. To convert, add !.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\n\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\n\nAgain, forced Unwrapping is not recommended as shown below.\n\nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\n// let newBobAge = bobAge! // Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to normal type in Swift. It violates the rule mentioned above.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"Bob's pretty image\"\n\nif let image = profileImageFromFacebook {\n  print(image)\n}\n\nSource Code\n1101_Optionals\nResources\nFeel free to check if you are confused.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Optionals (YouTube)\nConclusion\nBoom! Now you finally understand the why Swift engineering have implemented optionals and how to use them. To be more specific, you've learned two fundamental concepts in optionals. The rule number one is that every variable type even if it's optionals type has to be defined whether explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are ways to unwrap optionals to normal values. Force using the ! mark and safe using if let. In our next lesson, you are learning how to apply optionals when you create an object and play around with its properties and methods.

But, have you ever wondered why you see those ? and ! automatically added when you randomly try to get properties and methods in object? If you haven't, that's okay. You will find out. The goal is to prevent you from guessing and checking. Let's find out what's really going under the hood.

Please remember that if you see any ? then make sure you unwrap implicitly. If you have any questions, make sure check out resources and HipChat if you have any questions.\nIn our next lesson, you are learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap and why you use it in the first place instead of using if let.

We are at lesson 3 of Part 1 of Swift fundamentals with Bob. First of all, let me share with you a story of mine first. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an else-if statement. It wasn't a big deal. For example, if something is true, you run this block, if not, else, you run that. However, a guard statement confused the heck out of me. I don't know why. Maybe some of you guys feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. But a guard statement provides a feeling zen which means clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Well, let's find out why.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nIs there any better way to write an else-if statement? How do you safely unwrap many optionals?\nTypical else-if\nWithout knowing guard statements, you used a long else-if statement to handle an error message block by calling else.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with else-if\n\nNested brackets\nRead every line to spot error\n\nGuard Statement\nIt provides early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"You can't drink\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with else-if\n// Unwrap using else-if\n\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"URL\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = 21\n\n// If I find \"nil\" in any of these variables, don't do anything\n\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n         print(\"Your name is \\(name).

How was the lesson just now? I hope you understand the power of using a guard statement that it provides an early exit and you don't have to read all the way to the bottom. You are using a guard statement not because just to please yourself, but also for the sake of your teammate's hair so it doesn't turn grey when he/she is reading your code. Okay, great. In next our lesson, we are going to learn another ! and ? for type casting which allows you to convert types.

I think you might be a little tired of seeing these ! and ? since Lesson 1. However, this is the most confusing concept in Swift, so we had to go over. I just wanted to be on the same as you guys are. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created classes. I don't think I need to talk to much. I will show the example right away. Let's dive into.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as! ?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\nType Casting from UIKit\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese that inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce()\nbob.singGangNamStyle()\n\nType Casting\nThere are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting is all about going to its base/super class. Imagine the UIKIt class structure. If you may upcast UILable to UIView. To upcast, use as.\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\nnewBob.singGangNamStyle() // Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting the opposite of upcasting. Downcasting may fail. As a result, you may as force downcasting or implicit downcasting.\nForce Downcasting (!)\nIt does not return an optional type but it fails, crashes.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\n\n\nDowncasting only applies when you upcast first.\n\nSafe Downcasting (?)\nIt returns an optional type. If downcasting fails, returns nil.\n// Implicit Downcasting (safety)\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nGroup\nExplicit upcasting\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nAutomatic upcasting inferred\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nCall Method in Element\nfor human in humans {\n\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n\n}\n\nSource Code\n1104_Type Casting\nResources\nIf you are still confused with type casting, feel free to watch my YouTube video I posted earlier.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorials with Bob: Type Casting (YouTube)\nConclusion\nGreat job, if you've understood what type casting is finally. It is somewhat similar to optionals right? You've learn two ways convert types. One is upcasting, as, which always works because you are going up to super class and you getting rid of properties and methods. The other way downcasting which is become more specific, but as you've seen it may work and may not work. Therefore you use either as?to safely convert or as! to force convert. You are going to find out how type casting is such a beautiful thing when it comes to grouping objets. You will find out in Part 2 of this course. I know you are excited, just bear with me for a second. In our next lesson, we are going to deal with another ? and !. It's going to be the last one, and you will no longer fear those red signs on the left.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1105_error_handling.html","title":"Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of Part 1: Swift Intermediates with Bob. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to write modular and more explicit code to indicate a possible error message instead of using a bloated, thick else-if statement. If you are confused, that's alright. I will walk you through, and let's find out!\nLecture Notes\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers this function can result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish try?, try!, an try\n\nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated Function\nModularity\n\nCreate a program for a roller coaster ride height limit\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbeat Tighten\n\n  } else if height \nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to deal with error messages\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to Error protocol. Determine a few cases.\n// Design Error\nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, you must call it by putting try in front of the function within a do block. A catch block is used to handle error thrown by the function.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling to Object Creation\nError handling not only applies to functions, but also objects.\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, it will throw NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an object using try within do.\nInit and Handle Error\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Please make sure put something\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\ntry? vs try!\ntry is only used within a do-catch block. However, try? and try! can be used without it. In other words, you can only call a method or init, without handling error.\ntry?\nIt returns an optional value if it is used for init. If it throw an error, the result will be nil.\nlet newCourse = try? Course(name: \"Bob the Dev\") // returns Course?\nlet newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: \"\") // nil\n\ntry!\nIt will return a normal type if is used for init. If a method/init throws an error, it will crash.\n// try!\nlet myNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"Bobby Lee\")\n// let myDopeNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"\")\n\nSource Code\n1105_Error Handling\nResources\nIntro to Error Handling (Blog)\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the motivation for using Swift Errror Handling snytax such as catch, do, and try instead of writing a else-if statement to handle unexpected outcomes. You've also learned the differences between try, try?, and try!. You can only use try when you use it within a do block. However, if you don't care about catching errors that thrown, you may use try? and try!. But make sure never use ! because it can crash at any time.\nThat's it guys. You've covered the entire ! and ? such as type casting, error handling, optionals, and optional chaning. I'm so proud of how much you've come, and you will find out how these Swift concepts play a major role in Part 2 of the course and of course Part 3. In our next lesson, we are learn how make ourselves dry. In other words, we are going to prevent us from repeating our code.

When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought you want to write code that can work with many other types. Haha, I know you are super confused, I will walk you through. But remember, the number goal is to write reusable code so that we do not repeat ourself.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI feel like I'm repeating myself...\nYour Past\nLet us reflect on how you access value before you encounter generics\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nWorst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nYou create a function that loops through an element.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle. Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nYou may create a function that may pass regardless of type\nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nYou may pass any type of value. Swift sets the type of value as the type of the input.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // value is String\ngenericFunction(value: true)    // value is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us apply to a function that loops through an array.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA)\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople)\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNon-Generic Struct\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members\n\nGeneric Struct\nYou may create a generic struct.\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object Explicitly\n// Generic whose type is String\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\n// Generic whose type is Int\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nCreate Object Implicitly\nStruct type inferred based on the property type.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // struct is now Int type\n\nGeneric Extension\nGrab the first value\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement\n\nType Constraint\nYou may limit type you interact with\nCreate Class\nclass LOL {}\nclass BabyLol: LOL {}\n\nCreate Function with Constraint\nCreate a function that only takes an input whose type is LOL\nfunc addClassOnly(array: [T]) {}\n\n// addClassOnly(array: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, ])\n// Error\n\naddClassOnly(array: [LOL(), LOL(), LOL()])\naddClassOnly(array: [LOL(), LOL(), LOL(), BabyLol()]) // Automatically Upcasted\n\nResources\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Extension (YouTube)\nIntro to Generics in Swift with Bob (Blog)\nSource Code\n1106_Generics\nConclusion\nThat's it! Generics are such a powerful tool to the point the Swift library is, in fact, created with generic code, not all , but many. To recap, you've learned how to make a generic function by putting a diamond sign on the right. You've also learned how to create generic struct as well as how to put a type constraint. You've learned a lot. I'm very proud of you. You might not find generics as useful in this course, but when you start learning practical protocol oriented programming, functional programming, and rx reactive which is going to my next upcoming course, you will learn how generics dominate everywhere.

What if I told you right now that you can create a shortcut? I know it sounds super super abstract. But, I will walk you through. I know you guys trust me more than any. Let's dive into it.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI want a shortcut without calling a method.\nNormal Method\nCreate a class called, HelloKitty which contains a method that returns a string value.\nstruct HelloKitty {\n  func saySomething() -> String {\n    return \"I'm Cute\"\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance and call saySomething()\nlet babe = HelloKitty()\nbabe.saySomething()\n\nSubscripts\nSubscripts provide shortcuts. It is analogous to creating a method but without a name.\nstruct WeekDays {\n  var days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n\n  subscript(index: Int) -> String {\n    return days[index]\n  }  \n}\n\nAccess Shortcut\nCall the subscript by entering [].\nlet myDays = WeekDays()\n\nmyDays[0]  // \"Monday\"\nmyDays[1]  // \"Tuesday\"\n\nDictionary\nWhen you access elements in a dictionary, it always returns an optional type.\nvar info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Body Fat\": 12.5, \"Weight\": 76]\n\nlet height = info[\"Eye Color\"] // height is optional string\n\nArtificial Dictionary Subscript\nAccess element without returning an optional type\nstruct HealthInfo {\n  var info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Body Fat\": 12.5, \"Weight\": 76]\n\n  subscript(key: String) -> Double {\n    if let newInfo = info[key] {\n      return newInfo\n    } else {\n      return 0\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nAccess Elements\nReturn normal type\nlet bob = HealthInfo()\nbob[\"Height\"]         // 183\nbob[\"Body Fat\"]        // 12.5\nbob[\"123456789\"]       // 0\n\nShortcoming of Subscript\nNo Context means ☠️\nResources\nSource Code\n1107_Subscripts\nConclusion\nGreat, Now do you know what I mean by creating a shortcut? I'm sure now you do. I told you so. However, subscripts can be quite misleading because there is no name to it. As a result, it might confusion if your teammate starts to read your code, and he/she might get confused. So make sure, don't use it too often. Somtimes, it might be better for you to use a property or method for clarity. An Apple engineering once said, brevity is not the worthwhile goal. Communication is important because programming langauge is not only the way humans talk to computers, but also between a human to human.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1100/1108_class_vs_struct.html":{"url":"1000/1100/1108_class_vs_struct.html","title":"Class vs Struct","keywords":"","body":"Class vs Struct\nIntroduction\nGreat to see you at lesson 8 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob.

Steve Jobs once said, when we are at the present moment, we can't really understand how certain incidents or knowledge build our future. He said, however, when you look into the past, you understand how the dots are connected. For example, Steve Jobs took calligraphy course in college. The skill he learned allowed him to produce beautiful products.\nI already know your future, of course within this course. I've designed this course in terms of what you are going to learn. If you feel as if you don't really know why you are learning this,  when you start making real apps in Part 2 and Part 3, you will start to see how everything fits together.

For those who feel confident with OOP but you don't know when to use it, you've come to the right place as well.\nWelcome to the very first lesson of this chapter, advanced Object Oriented Programming. So far, you should definitely what it means to initialize an object using Struct and Class. In fact, we've been doing it for awhile. You should know also definitely know what it means to have properties and methods within an object.\nRemember guys, OOP is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. You can't go against it.

How to become lazy, or in other words, become smart when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable. Bill Gates once said, Whenever there is hard work to be done, I assign it to the laziest man as he is sure to find an easy way of doing it. Be Lazy. Think Crazy!\" Let's get started.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n var name: String\n\n init(name: String) {\n   self.name = name\n }\n\n init(_ newName: String) {\n   name = newName\n }\n\n}\n\nConvenience Init\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  init(_ newName: String) {\n    name = newName\n  }\n\n convenience init() {\n   self.init(name: \"Bob\")\n }\n\n convenience init(enterNumber: Int) {\n   self.init(name: String(enterNumber))\n }\n\n}\n\nCreate Objects\nlet ben = Human(\"Hi\")  // init(_ newName: String)\nlet leob = Human()  // convenience init()\nlet bob = Human(name: \"Bob\")  // init(name: String)\n\nlet rob = Human()  // Convenience Init()\nrob.name  // \"Bob\"\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet randomColorWtihMe = UIColor(r: 20, g: 10, b: 50)\n\nSource Code\n1201_Convenience Init\nConclusion\nWhat do you think? You've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time. Imagine you are creating a library or a group of code for your teammates to use. Your teammate no longer has to use a designated init method initialize an object. It's a win-win situation. In our next lesson, let's talk about whether initialization might fail. Take care, and keep developing your skills and mind.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1200/1202_failable_init.html":{"url":"1000/1200/1202_failable_init.html","title":"Failable Init","keywords":"","body":"Failable Init\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. In this lesson you are going learn how to design an init method that, first, possibly returns no object and, second, even throw an error using error handling. I understand it sounds quite confusing to you right now. So, let's dive into it.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nCan initialization fail? Okay, how?\nFailable Init\nInsert ? right after init. When the init method is called, you may return nil.  If initialization is successful, it returns an object whose type is optional.\nclass Product {\n  let name: String\n  init?(name: String) {\n    if name.isEmpty { return nil }\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nvar iOSGeeKCommunity = Product(name: \"iOS Geek Community\") // returns Product?\nvar myNewProduct = Product(name: \"\") // nil\n\nprint(myNewProduct)\nmyNewProduct?.name\nprint(iOSGeeKCommunity?.name)\n\nError Handling with Init\n\nThis is a review from 1105_Error Handling.\n\nDesign Error\n// Second Part: Throwing Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Struct\nIf the user enters an empty string value, it throws NameError.noName.\nstruct UdemyCourse {\n  let courseName: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    }\n    self.courseName = name\n  }\n}\n\nCall and Handle Error\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try UdemyCourse(name: \"Bob\")\n  myCourse.courseName\n\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Bob, please enter the name\")\n}\n\ntry?\nIf error is thrown, it will return nil. If not, it will return an optional object.\nvar myCourse = try? UdemyCourse(name: \"Bob Lee\")\nmyCourse // Optional\n\ntry!\nIf error is thrown, it will crash. If not, it will return a non-optional object.\nvar newCourse = try! UdemyCourse(name: \"\") // Crash\n\nResources\nThis is a review for you if you are not still familiar with Error Handling.\nIntro to Error Handling (Blog)\nSource Code\n1202_Failable Init\nConclusion\nYou've done two things with me in this lesson. First, you've learned how design an init method can return nil or optional type by putting a ? right to the init. As we talked about it before. Anything that has ? in Swift will give you an optional value. Second, you've revisited error handling. The throws keyword is not only used within an else-if block, but also it can used for an init method. Take care, keep practicing and developing your skill my friend. See you in the next lesson.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1200/1203_computed_property.html":{"url":"1000/1200/1203_computed_property.html","title":"Computed Property","keywords":"","body":"Computed Property\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. Today, we are going to learn how to create relationship between variables. So that you don't need to manage two variable separately. Are you confused? Well, have you heard, get and set before? Haven't? No worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine. Let's dive into it.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate radius.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. You may not customize. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nvar gettaleNumber: Double {\n get {\n   return 123.2\n }\n}\n\nShorter way to express a gettable property by removing the get keyword.\nvar readableVariable: Double {\n return 20\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\ngettableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableVariable = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n get {\n   return radius * 20\n } set {\n   radius = newValue / 2  // newValue refers to recently set value of diameter\n }\n}\n\nNow, if you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100. As a result, radius will be 50. If you set radius to 500, diameter will be 1000.\nInstead of calling newValue, you may name the recently set value as you wish. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, I call it as newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\n\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n } set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\narea = 400 // side becomes 20\n\nSource Code\n1203_Computed Property\nConclusion\nBoom! In the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a gettable property by calling get or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add set which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps. You will learn how everything fits together in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course.

In this lesson, you are going to learn what it truly means by the world super. A lot of beginners often just type because of what they have seen on StackOver Flow or tutorials, today we are going to dive in what's really going on. There are a lot of examples, so let's get started with me, Bob the Developer.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nProblem: Super... Super.init?\nUIViewController\nYou might have seen something like this below. Many wonder what super and override stand for. Let us find out.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n override func viewDidLoad() {\n   super.viewDidLoad()\n   print(\"Hello\")\n }\n}\n\nCreate Vehicle Class\nCreate a class called Vehicle. It contains one gettable property and one method.\nclass Vehicle {\n\n var description: String {\n   return \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr\"\n }\n\n func warning() {\n   print(\"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\")\n }\n\n}\n\nSubclass\nYou may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n\n let price = \"$100\"\n\n override var description: String {\n   return \"\\(super.description), I'm \\(price)\"\n }\n\n override func warning() {\n   super.warning() // \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n   print(\"Let me just tell you, I'm not dangerous much\")\n }\n\n}\n\nSubclass Object\nCreate an object to check if the method and property have been overriden in the subclass,ToyCar.\nlet myCar = ToyCar()\nmyCar.description\nmyCar.warning()\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override init from super class. The number one rule is: you must put value to every property\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain one property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n\n let name: String\n\n init(enterName: String) {\n   name = enterName\n   super.init(enterOrgin: \"Bob the Developer\")\n }\n\n init(enterName: String, myOrigin: String) {\n   name = enterName\n   super.init(enterOrgin: myOrigin)\n }\n\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initializes the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nSimilar to how you may override a method and property, you may include additional code when you call the overriden init method.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla. It contains a property called, numberOfWheels.\nclass Tesla {\n var numberOfWheels: Int\n\n init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n   numberOfWheels = enterWheelNumber\n }\n}\n\nOverride Init\nYou may override the init method within the Tesla class. Let us add a print statement when you call the init method.\nclass ModelS: Tesla {\n override init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n   super.init(enterWheelNumber: 500)  // Calling the init method\n   print(\"Yo, I've cerated this object bruh\")\n }\n}\n\nlet myFutureSexyCar = ModelS(enterWheelNumber: 500)\n// print(\"Yo, I've cerated this object bruh\")\n\nmyFutureSexyCar.numberOfWheels // 500\n\nSource Code\n1204_Override Init/Method\nConclusion\nNow, you understand. What's really going on with super.init, super.viewDidLoad, override, super.property. By now, I hope you understand why we use super. Again, I like to use this analogy when it comes to iOS development. Building an app in this ecosystem is like operating a microwave. We definitely need to know how to read manuals which is analogous to being able to read the Swift programming language. To heat up your food, all you have to do is press a couple of buttons and then lights comes off from the side of the wall and the food starts heating up. We don't know exactly how the details work such as particle movements and electromagnetism, but we do know how to operate,  In iOS programming, our job is to learn how to operate and understand why Apple engieers have implemented such features such as Error Handling and Computer Property. Remember this statement,\n\nFocus on why we use it over why it works. You understand their motives, not the principle behind it because you can't understand why it works. It just works. Microwave jsut works. When you tap on your phone, it just works. Why they did it because it's convenient and easy to use it. Why it works? It's too complicated. I don't know.\n\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1200/1205_two_phase_init.html":{"url":"1000/1200/1205_two_phase_init.html","title":"Two Phase Init","keywords":"","body":"Two Phase Init\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. In this lesson, you are going to learn how can one init method init the other. Sounds super confusing? Well, let's find out how it certainly works. In fact, it's super important. You will find out why by the end of this lesson. It could have three million dollars for NASA.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nHow can one init init the other?\nDesign Struct\nDesign a struct called NuclearRocket. There are two init methods and two properties: meters and liters. Using the second init method, you may initialize using ft and gallon. However, the second init will call the first init method by calling self.init. This is analogous to convenience init you've learned in 1201.\nstruct NuclearRocket {\n  var meters: Double\n  var liters: Double\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1F0;&#x1F1F7;\n  init(meters: Double, liters: Double) {\n    self.meters = meters\n    self.liters = liters\n  }\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;\n  init(ft: Double, gallons: Double) {\n    let convertedMeters = ft / 3.28\n    let convertedLiters = gallons * 3.79\n    self.init(meters: convertedMeters, liters: convertedLiters)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nFor Korean scientist\nvar rocket = NuclearRocket(meters: 20, liters: 20)\nrocket.liters\nrocket.meters\n\nFor American scientist\nvar newRocket = NuclearRocket(ft: 300, gallons: 2)\nnewRocket.liters\nnewRocket.meters\n\nSource Code\n1205_Two Phase Init\nConclusion\nGreat, to be honest, I haven't used two phase init in my previous apps before, but I just wanted to make sure when you read someone's code, you are ready to rock and roll. But, you could create a program that allow you to convert easily.\nThe Mars Climate robot launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, Martian atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars .However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound (force)-seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) $327.6 million total gone.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1200/1206_property_observer.html":{"url":"1000/1200/1206_property_observer.html","title":"Property Observer","keywords":"","body":"Property Observer\nIntroduction\nYou guys know how I'm going to start, right? Welcome to Lesson 6 of The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob, Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. You are going to learn how to put a tracker to a property. For example, never mind. Let's find out!\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nHow can I add observer/tracker to a property?\nwillSet and didSet\n\nwillSet is called just before the value is set\ndidSet is called immediately after the new value is set.\n\nCreate Step Counter\nCreate a variable called, totalSteps. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed. In the willSet block, newTotalSteps refers to the new value stored. In the didSet block, oldValue refers to the previous value before totalSteps encounters a new value.\nvar totalSteps: Int = 20 {\n willSet(newTotalSteps) {\n   print(\"About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)\")\n }\n didSet {\n   if totalSteps > oldValue  {\n     print(\"Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps\")\n   }\n }\n}\n\ntotalSteps = 100  \n// About to set totalSteps to 100\n// Added 80 steps\n\nReal Life Application\nYou may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the apps.\nvar userLoggedIn: Bool = false {\n willSet(newValue) {\n   print(\"The user has tried something\")\n }\n didSet {\n   if userLoggedIn {\n     print(\"The user switched from \\(oldValue) to \\(userLoggedIn)\")\n   }\n }\n}\n\nuserLoggedIn = false\n// \"The user has tried something\"\nuserLoggedIn = true\n// \"The user has tried something\"\n// \"The user switched from false to true\"\n\nSource Code\n1206_Property Observer\nConclusion\nGreat! Do you think you learned something with me? I'm sure you have. The whole purpose of using property observer is to write less code but provide greater readability. You don't have to create a bunch of Switch or else-if statement, functions to do what we did. As you've seen there are ways ways to check whether user has been logged or not, computed property for me at least, works the best because it provides a separate block of code.

Today, you are going to learn one of the most confused topics when it comes to Object Oriented Programming and type methods and properties. If you aren't with this, don't you worry my friend. You might a bit confused, but you will come out strong, confident, and pumped. You will be excited to apply what you will learn today in your code later. Enough of talking. Let's go!\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI'm so confused by Static, Final, Class. What are those?\nStatic Property and Method\nAnything that has static in front will not be overriden. In fact, static is the only type property and method used within struct since it does not provide inheritance.\nstruct SomeStructure {\n static var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\n static var computedProperty: Int {\n   get {\n     return 120\n   }\n   set {\n     print(\"You've set to \\(newValue)\")\n   }\n }\n\n static func hello() {\n   print(\"hello\")\n }\n}\n\nAccess properties\nSomeStructure.computedProperty = 150\nSomeStructure.computedProperty = 24234\n\nClass\nUnlike static, class is only used within Classes. But, Classes also support static. It's just that it won't be overridden.\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called GrandParent. It contains one static property and one static method. It also contains a normal method and another method with final attached.\nclass GrandParent {\n static var numberOfYearsInMarriage = 30\n static func introduce() {\n   print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n }\n\n func sayHi() {\n   print(\"What's popping?\")\n }\n\n final func sayHello() {\n   print(\"What Up?\")\n }\n\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nNow, create Parent class that inherits GrandParent.  You may override func sayHi(), but you may not override final func sayHello(). final prevents Classes from overriding. It's similar to static.\nclass Parent: GrandParent {\n override func sayHi() {\n   super.sayHi()\n   print(\"I'm a parent\")\n }\n\n//  final func sayHello() {\n//    print(\"What Up?\")\n//  }\n\n}\n\nAccess Type Property and Method\nNow, let us access numberOfYearsInMarriage and introduction whose both are static from the GrandParent class. If you use static, you may inherit, but you can't override.\nParent.numberOfYearsInMarriage // 30\nParent().sayHi()  // Good\nParent().sayHello() // Good\n\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called, Human that contains two type properties.\nclass Human {\n static var legs = 2\n\n // class var name = \"Bob\"\n // Stored property not valid for class var\n\n class var myName: String {\n   return \"Human\"\n }\n\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\n\nAgain, subclasses can override class methods/properties, but cannot override static methods properties.\n\nCreate a class called, Bob that inherits Human. Attempt to override myName class type property.\nclass Bob: Human {\n override class var myName: String {\n   return \"My name is Bob\"\n }\n}\n\nPractical Usage\nYou may store a list of items using the follow way below.\nclass BluetoothID {\n struct iPhone {\n   static let iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n   static let iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n   static let iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n   static let iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n   static let iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n }\n}\n\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8\n\nYou may also use enum. but I prefer the method above since I do n't have to call rawValue.\nenum AirDropID: String {\n case iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n case iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n case iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n case iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n case iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n}\n\nAirDropID.iPhone8.rawValue // \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nResources\nSource Code\n1207_Type Property and Method\nConclusion\nRemember a couple things. First, if you use final or static, that means you can inherit, but you can not override. Second, when you are using class property, you have to use computed property for some reason I couldn't find out. Third, if you've learned something, let me see. Good for you. Keep developing, and you will see how everything fits together like the human digestive system.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1200/1208_conclusion.html":{"url":"1000/1200/1208_conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nYou've completed Chapter 2 Advanced Object Oriented Programming with me.

A lot of books and courses do not cover the fundamentals and expects new developers to use them. It's analogous to not knowing what super.viewDidLoad is but you just use it because it somehow works.

When I learned Swift as my firsts programming language, I had a really hard time understanding closures. I avoided it as much as possible, and I didn't know why we use it in the first place. It took me good 3 months to completely understand Closures. So, I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures taking by taking a couple of lessons. It is hard, and you just have to admit it. It's riding a bicycle for the first time. You just have to fall and feel uncomfortable until you get used it. It's like seeing a mathematical formula you've never seen before. You just have to get used it. Enough said, let's find out how closures is different from normal functions. Brace yourself.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nWho are you closures? () -> ()?\nDefinition\nA closure is a function without name and the func keyword (for now).\nFunctions\nCreate a function that add two numbers.\nfunc addTwoNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nFirst Class Citizen\nYou may store a function into a variable/constant.\nvar addFunction = addTwoNumbers\naddFunction(10, 14) // 24\naddFunction(14, 21) // 35\n\nIntroducing Closures\nStore closures into a variable. A closure begins with {. In order to store into a variable/constant, you must specify its type.\nvar addClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = { (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosures(4, 10) // 14\naddClosures(52, 123) // 178\n\nShort Form\nYou may not enter return after in if only if you enter the value that the closure expects to return.\nvar sumWithClosure: (Int, Int) -> Int = { (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  number1 + number2\n}\n\nShortest Form\nAs long as you specify the type, you may not create an argument label. You may just insert $0 or $1.\nvar sumWithClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\nsumWithClosures(4, 10)\n\nMore Examples\n// No paramter. Just return String\nlet closureString: () -> String = { () in\n  return \"hello\"\n}\n\n// Identical example as above, but shorter form\nlet closuresString: () -> String = { \"hello\" }\nclosuresString()\n\n// Enter two parameters and return Int\nvar timesClosure: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 * $1 }\ntimesClosure(523, 12321)\n\nResource\nIf you are not familiar with closures, you may watch this introductory video. You have to get used to it. Again, it took me ages to a couple weeks to get used to it. You must understand. Keep googling on your own.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial: Closures (YouTube)\nSource Code\n1301_Closures vs Functions\nClosure Part 1\nClosure Part 2\nConclusion\nDo you feel uncomfortable or confused? That's okay. It's just a part of the process of acquiring knowledge. You struggle to learn because it indicates that you are not in your comfort zone. Learning is done by your. So, if you need to, refer to my resources, and google until you figure out what's going on. Don't give up. I hope you are able to distinguish the difference between a function and variable. Remember you can store a function into a variable and carry it around. Also, when you make a closure, you must indicate its type. You've learned how to write a closure statement using longer as well as shorter syntax by putting dollar signs and eliminating in and return.

Create a function that takes a closure whose type is () -&gt; String.\nfunc insertClosure(closure: () -> String) -> String{\n  return closure()\n}\n\ninsertClosure(closure: returnString)\n\n\nDisclosure: Function is called Global Closure\n\nReturn Closure\nNow only you may pass a closure to a function block, you may return a closure.\nfunc returnClosure() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { (number1, number2) in number1 + number2 }\n}\n\nlet returnedClosure = returnClosure()\nreturnedClosure(5, 10)\n\nreturnClosure()(5, 15)\n\nReturn Short Closures\nYou might get confused by this. Again, a closure begins with { and ends with }.\nfunc returnShortClosure() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { $0 * $1 }\n}\n\nreturnShortClosure()(10, 10) // 100\n\nResources\nIf you are not familiar with closures, it takes a while for you to get used to it. I highly recommend you to read my article on No Fear Closures with Bob Part 1 and Part 2.\nSource Code\n1302_Closures vs Functions (Part 2)\nConclusion\nIf you were to take away one thing, please remember this. You can pass closure to an argument label and even return closure. This is the basis of functional programming, which I'm not going to dive into.

This is the very last chapter of Part 1 Swift Intermediate Fundamentals. You've come a long way, my friend.  In this chapter, you are going to learn how to stay away from Object Oriented Programming to implement certain features. Unlike OOP, Protocol Oriented Programming allows you to write non-nested code. In other words, your code becomes flat and easy to read. I'm sure you are curious to know more. Let's get into it. Again, in this course, we are not going to dive too deeply with POP, however you will still be able to reduce a lot more lines of code.

Before I talk about details, I'd like to share with you that learning Protocol was such a daunting task. Not only it was located at the end of the Swift documentation, but it just felt really foreign to me. It sounded scary. Of course, it feels natural to use it, so I understand if you are not comfortable with it. I just would like to tell you that you might have to watch this video multiple times to get by. You might have to read 10 more articles for you to fully get comfortable. I really expect you guys to be proactive when you are confused. I will do my part which is to explain in the most clear way possible. Well, let's get started from the bottom with me. Let's go!\nLecture Notes\nThere are certainly benefits of using OOP, but the opposites as well.\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. Your object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can f up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\nProblem\nProblem: I don't know Protocol\n\nProtocol is like a basketball coach. He/she tells players what to do, but he/she doesn't know how to dunk.\n\nProtocol\nCreate a protocol called, Rookieable. It contains two properties and one method. Do not worry about get and set for now.\nprotocol Rookieable {\n  var numberOfEXP: String { get set }\n  var name: String { get }\n\n  func introduce()\n}\n\nCreate a class that conforms to Rookieable just like how you would subclass. To prevent Swift from screaming, you must implement two properties and one method defined in the protocol.\nclass Bob: Rookieable {\n  // Stored property has no effect on get or set\n  var numberOfEXP: String = \"13\"\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name) and I have \\(numberOfEXP) years of experience\")\n  }\n\n}\n\nCreate an object and call the introduce method.\nBob().introduce()\n\n\n{ get } or { get set} only apply to computed property. If you are defining a stored property, you may choose either { get } or { get set }.\n\nComputed Property\nCreate a protocol called, Breathable. It contains two properties: isBreathing and isLiving.\nprotocol Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool { get set }\n  var isLiving: Bool { get }\n}\n\nCreate a struct that conforms to Breathable. The struct contains properties: isBreathing and isLiving. Define them as computed properties rather than stored.\nstruct Human: Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set { } // If no set, error occurs. isBreathing is { get set }\n  }\n\n  var isLiving: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set { }\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nRule: If you are using a computer property, if it is { get } you may make a property gettable or settable. If it is defined as { get set } within a protocol, you must make it gettable and settable.\n\nResources\nSource Code\n1401_Protocol Basics\nConclusion\nAre you wrapping your heads around? Again, make sure you remember a couple rules. If you use { get } or { get set }. You can both use it as a stored property and change the value as you wish. However, if you identify a property with { get set } please remember if you use computed property, you have to make it settable as well. For { get }, you can do whatever you want. In our next lesson, you are going to see some of practical aspects of Protocol. You've only seen the tip of an ice berg. Let's get started my friend. Super excited to make you smarter.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"1000/1400/1402_protocol_extension.html":{"url":"1000/1400/1402_protocol_extension.html","title":"Protocol Extension","keywords":"","body":"Protocol Extension\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming.

Let's dive in.\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI don't even want to type anymore.\nCreate Protocol\nCreate a protocol called MathGenius that contains one method.\nprotocol MathGenius {\n  func calculateGPA()\n}\n\nCreate Protocol Extension\nCreate an extension to MathGenius. The extension contains a default method.\nextension MathGenius {\n  func calculateGPA() {\n    print(\"I'm too cool for school\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate a struct that conforms to MathGenius. Since the extension provides a default method, you no longer have to specify the required method. If you do, it will override the default method.\nstruct Bob: MathGenius {\n  // Override\n}\n\nBob().calculateGPA() // \"I'm too cool for school\"\n\nstruct Bobby: MathGenius {}\nBobby().calculateGPA() // \"I'm too cool for school\"\nBobby.init() // Same as calling Bobby()\n\nPractical Protocol Extension\nCreate a protocol that contains a method that takes two Double parameters and return String.\nprotocol FindAreable {\n  func calculateArea(side: Double, length: Double) -> String\n}\n\nCreate an extension to FindAreable which will return a statement whose type is in String.\nextension FindAreable {\n\n  func calculateArea(side: Double, length: Double) -> String {\n    let area = String(side * length)\n     return \"The area is \\(area)\"\n  }\n}\n\nEvery struct and class that conforms to FindArea contains the default calculateArea method from the extension.\nstruct Square: FindAreable {}\n\nSquare.init().calculateArea(side: 4, length: 100)\n\nlet bigSquare = Square.init()\nbigSquare.calculateArea(side: 100, length: 20)\n\nstruct Hexagon: FindAreable {}\nHexagon().calculateArea(side: 6, length: 20)\n\nUsage Case\nUIAnimation.\nResources\nIf you are interested in how you may apply Protocol to UIKit, you may read Protocol Oriented View with Bob (Blog).

Protocol Oriented Programming is only limited by your imagination. It's really up to you how you can start using it. If you've ever done coding before or you are going to, take a moment, and really imagine and visualize how Protocol Oriented Programming can be applied. In this course, I'm not here to feed you.

Imagining, wake the fuck up. Don't reply on me. Don't expect me to feed you. If you are thinking, great job. I'm really proud of you. In the next lesson, you are going to learn the most important concept in iOS programming. If you don't understand this, you are just going to be a code monkey.

There are a lot of bullshit tutorials out there. You've come to the right place. Let me tell you the majority of people don't understand what's going on, and they simply copy off from the screen. Have you ever seen, tableView.delegate = self? What the heck is that?\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nI don't get it.\n\nYou just have to memorize it. It's a gift from Apple engineers. Take it. Do not question why it works. But, find out why it is useful.You might have to watch this video multiple times\n\nPass Data from ClassOne to ClassTwo\nCreate a protocol called, PassDataDelegate. It contains a method that takes data whose type is in String and returns String.\nprotocol PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String) -> String\n}\n\nCreate a class that contains an optional property whose type is PassDataDelegate?.\nclass ClassOne {\n  var delegate: PassDataDelegate?\n}\n\nIf you call the method, passData associated with the property, delegate, it will return nil since you have not initialized delegate.\nClassOne().delegate?.passData(data: \"Bob\")\n\nCreate ClassTwo that conforms to PassDataDelegate.  ClassTwo must contain passData(data: String).\nclass ClassTwo: PassDataDelegate {\n\n  func passData(data: String) -> String {\n    return \"You passed \\(data)\"\n  }\n\n}\n\nCreate instances\nlet classOne = ClassOne()\nlet classTwo = ClassTwo()\n\nSet classOne.delegate to classTwo. It is possible since classTwo conforms to PassDataDelegate.\nclassOne.delegate = classTwo // you are sending data to classTwo\n\nAs soon as you make the relationship like above, whenver you call a method from classOne, you pass data to classTwo and execute the required method.\nclassOne.delegate?.passData(data: \"123124124\")\n//  \"You passed 123124124\"\nclassOne.delegate?.passData(data: \"Hello\")\n// \"You passed Hello\"\n\nSource code\n1404_Delegate\nResources\nConclusion\nGreat, how was it guys?
