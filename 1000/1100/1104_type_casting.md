# Type Casting

## Introduction
Welcome back to lesson 4 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob. I think you might be a little tired of seeing these `!` and `?` since Lesson 1. However, this is the most confusing concept in Swift, so we had to go over. I just wanted to be on the same as you guys are. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created classes. I don't think I need to talk to much. I will show the example right away. Let's dive into.

## Conclusion
Great job, if you've understood what type casting is finally. It is somewhat similar to optionals right? You've learn two ways convert types. One is upcasting, `as`, which always works because you are going up to super class and you getting rid of properties and methods. The other way downlcasting which is become more specific, but as you've seen it may work and may not work. Therefore you use either `as?`to safely convert or `as!` to force convert. You are going to find out how type casting is such a beautiful thing when it comes to grouping objets. You will find out in Part 2 of this course. I know you are excited, just bear with me for a second. In our next lesson, we are going to deal with another `?` and `!`. It's going to be the last one, and you will no longer fear those red signs on the left.
