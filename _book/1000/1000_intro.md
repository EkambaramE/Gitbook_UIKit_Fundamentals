# Part I: Swift 3 Intermediates

## Motivation
Welcome to Part One of The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob. You will learn intermediate Swift concepts which often many courses and books tend to skip due to complexity. However, these concepts are mandatory for you to understand the entire iOS ecosystem.

I'd like describe making an iOS app is like creative works such as you can write novels, poems, songs, and so forth. However, if you don't know how to read and write alphabets and grammar, you will make terrible books. You can still publish that books.

Often times, students get lost because instructors perceive these intermediate concepts to be "obvious" largely due to their past experience in iOS development. Many have lost the ability to relate with new students, a lack of empathy. I don't want to be one of those. I have been a student in school for the last 13 years in a row and I absolutely how it feels to learn something new.

## The Real Problem
Here is the real problem. Often times, when students learn iOS development for the first time, they get hyped, and all they want to do is building apps. So what happens is they start taking courses that market themselves as, "Take this course to become a full time developer and build 21 apps!". As a formal student learning Swift, I've taken and read many. However, I've soon found it's not just building apps. It's about becoming a self sustainable developer. Do you think you can replicate those apps on your own without copying from the screen like a code monkey?  In other words, courses must teach how to catch fish instead of feeding by them without knowing what they are eating. So, let's get started with the intermediate fundamentals.

## Organization of Part 1
There are four chapters that are the building blocks of the iOS ecosystem. Without an understanding these concepts in Swift, you will never be able to build apps without getting errors and not knowing what to do.

### Swift 3 Intermediate Fundamentals
Out of four chapters, in the first, you will learn the most commonly misunderstood and skipped concepts when beginners learn how to make apps for the first time. You will primarily understand why we use these features of Swift and how to use fix and prevent error messages on the left side of Playground or Xcode. From now on, You no longer have to guess and check.

### Advanced Object Oriented Programming
In the second chapter, it's all about Object Oriented Programming. Often beginners don't even know what `super` means under `viewDidLoad`. If you are one of them, don't worry. You have a greater understanding of Object Oriented Programming that prepares you to become proficient with UIKit objects in Part 2 of this course. Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS development ecosystem.

### Intro to Functional Programming
This is one of the most dreaded topic for beginner Swift developers. Many don't understand what closures are and how they are similar or different from functions. You are going to learn what Completion Handlers are and you will design your own.

### Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming
Protocol Oriented Programming is the rising star in iOS development. In this chapter, you will learn how and why such a paradigm is used and this will prepare for you to apply in Part 2 which is primarily for UIKits. Along with Functional Programming, it allows you to write readable and organized code. Also, you are going to learn what delegate truly means in iOS.

## Get Started
I know you are super excited as I'm. I've deleted dozens of videos and outlines to create this course, and this course has been delayed to meet my standard. I created this course as if I were in your shoes. That being said, enough of talk, let's dive in!
