# Computed Property

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 3 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. Today, we are going to learn how to create relationship between variables. So that you don't need to manage two variable separately. Are you confused? Well, have you heard, `get` and `set` before? Haven't? No worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine. Let's dive into it.

## Conclusion
Boom! In the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a `gettable` property by calling `get` or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add `set` which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps. You will learn how everything fits together in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course. Keep developing your skills and take care bye bye.
