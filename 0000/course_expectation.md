# Course Expectation
Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many programming languages out there. In fact, you will suffer, and I want it that way. Let me explain.

## Pain
No struggle means your brain is in a conform zone. It resists consuming information. Storing goes against the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics that things in nature want to scatter. Of course if you defy the law, you will face consequences.

It doesn’t mean struggles can't be fun. Perhaps, people attempt to climb the highest mountain and hold breath in icy water despite death threat. Struggles produce stories filled with hardships. They allow me to appreciate success more.

## Document
I'd like you to document your learning journey. You don't even need to create a website. You may blog on Medium or use Evernote. You may share with others. Although your journey may feel difficult, once you finally get it and share with the world, you feel accomplished. I guess that's why I love blogging.


## Be skeptical
Don't trust me all the way.  If you spot any practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased, and I might have bad practices although I try to prevent through doing my homework. Feel free to challenge and discuss.

## Do not listen to Xcode
You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Never ever click those red notifications on the left side without knowing what’s going on, and how you can prevent them in the future.


> I mentioned that learning was done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.


# Your Ideal Learning Stage
### 1. The Why
Each lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn such materials and features

### 2. Application
After having gone through a specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.

### 3. Resources
I attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.

### 4. Visualization
It's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough in 2017, by the current education system.

### 5. Testing
It's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new.
