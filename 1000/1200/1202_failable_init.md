# Failable Init

## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. In this lesson you are going learn how to design an init method that, first, possibly returns no object and, second, even throw an error using error handling. I understand it sounds quite confusing to you right now. So, let's dive into it.

## Conclusion
You've done two things with me in this lesson. First, you've learned how design an init method can return `nil` or optional type by putting a `?` right to the `init`. As we talked about it before. Anything that has `?` in Swift will give you an optional value. Second, you've revisited error handling. The `throws` keyword is not only used within an `else-if` block, but also it can used for an `init` method. Take care, keep practicing and developing your skill my friend. See you in the next lesson.
