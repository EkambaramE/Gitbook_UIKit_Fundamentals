# Protocol Oriented Programming
Welcome guys! This is the very last chapter of Part 1 Swift Intermediate Fundamentals. You've come a long way, my friend.  In this chapter, you are going to learn how to stay away from Object Oriented Programming to implement certain features. Unlike OOP, Protocol Oriented Programming allows you to write non-nested code. In other words, your code becomes flat and easy to read. I'm sure you are curious to know more. Let's get into it. Again, in this course, we are not going to dive too deeply with POP, however you will still be able to reduce a lot more lines of code. Stop subclassing!
