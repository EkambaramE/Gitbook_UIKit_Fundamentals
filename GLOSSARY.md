## Bob the Developer
This is my alias. Bob is such a competitive name on Google. So, I had to differentiate myself. Since I not only love programming, but also enjoy building my own brand and business. I've decided to use this name. If you'd like to know me more. You can follow my Instagram @bobthedev for my personal journey and daily activity.


## SangJoon
SangJoon is real Korean name. I'm a native Korean. But lived in different places. If you'd like to get to know my personal story, you can find more about me right [here](http://bobthedeveloper.io/about)
