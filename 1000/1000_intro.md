# Part I: Swift 3 Intermediates
Welcome to Part One of The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob. You will learn Swift concepts which often many courses and books tend to skip due to complexity. However, these concepts are mandatory for you understand the iOS ecosystem. Often students get lost because instructors perceive these concepts to be "obvious" largely due to their past experience in iOS development. They've lost the ability to relate with new students. In order to prevent that miscommunicate between you and me, I've designed this course to be thorough so that we are all on the same page.

There are four chapters. Each of them will give you a mixture theories and practical examples.

## Swift 3 Fundamentals
In this lesson, you will learn the most commonly misunderstood and skipped concepts when beginners learn how to make apps for the first time. You will primarily understand why you see those error messages on the left side of Playground or Xcode. You will never guess. In fact, you are less likely to see those problems since you know what to do.

* [Typealias](1000/1100/1109_typealias.md)


## Advanced Object Oriented Programming
Often beginners don't even know what `super` means under `viewDidLoad`. If you are one of them, don't worry. I was too for 3 months .You have a greater understanding of Object Oriented Programming so that there is no issue you will encounter when dealing with objects in UIKits.

* [Property Observer](1000/1200/1206_property_observer.md)
* [Type Property and Method](1000/1200/1207_type_property_method.md)

## Functional Programming
This is one of the most dreaded topic for beginner Swift developers. Many don't understand what closures are and how they are similar or different from functions. You are going to learn what Completion Handlers are and you will design your own. I will also introduce to functional programming and talk about their advantages compared to traditional ways to solve a problem. This topic could be the most challenging for many, and it's most likely be. 

* [Closures vs Functions](1000/1300/1301_closures_vs_functions.md)
* [Closures (Part 2)](1000/1300/1302_closures_part2.md)
* [Trailing Closures](1000/1300/1303_trailing_closures.md)
* [Completion Handlers](1000/1300/1304_completion_handlers.md)
* [Filter, Reduce, and Map](1000/1300/1305_filter_reduce_map.md)
* [Filter, Reduce, and Map (Part 2)](1000/1300/1306_filter_reduce_map_part2.md)
* [@escape and @autoclosures](1000/1300/1307_@escape_@autoclosures.md)

## Protocol Oriented Programming
Protocol Oriented Programming is the rising star in iOS development. In this chapter, you will learn how and why such a paradigm is used and this will prepare for you to apply in Part 2 which is primarily for UIKits. Along with Functional Programming, it allows you to write readable and organized code. Also, you are going to learn what delegate truly means in iOS.

* [Protocol Oriented Programming](1000/1400/1400_intro.md)
* [Introduction to Protocol](1000/1400/1401_intro_to_protocol.md)
* [Protocol Extension](1000/1400/1402_protocol_extension.md)
* [Protocol as Type](1000/1400/1403_protocol_as_type.md)
* [Delegate](1000/1400/1404_delegate.md)

## What's Next?
You are going to learn all these concepts apply in making real apps. Think about right is like learning how to read a sentence. In Part 2, you are going to learn how to write your own.
