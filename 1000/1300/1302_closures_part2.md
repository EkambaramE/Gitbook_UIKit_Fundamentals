# Closures vs Functions (Part 2)
## Introduction
Welcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Functional Programming. In our previous lesson, you've learned how to create a closure. Now, you are going to create a function that both use it as a parameter, and even returns it.

## Conclusion
If you were to take away one thing, please remember this. You can pass closure to an argument label and even return closure. This is the basis of functional programming, which I'm not going to dive into. If you want to register for the course, feel free to send me an email, `bobleesj@gmail.com` to receive personal updates from me, and receive special offers on books, courses, and so on. My next course will be about MVVM, Protocol Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and RxSwift. If you really want to improve your coding skill, I highly recommend it for you. You will be surprised how much you will learn more me. Keep developing your skill. If you are confused, make sure check out the resources, and keep googling and searching. Feel free to ask questions as well. s
