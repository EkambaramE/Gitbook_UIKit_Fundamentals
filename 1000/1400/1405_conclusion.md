## Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming Conclusion


Look, I'm not just here to present information. I'm going to repeat myself. If you are not comfortable with any of these concepts we've learned in POP, don't dare jumping to Part 2. If you do, you are a loser. You don't like challenges. You give up. Again, don't again go to Part 2 if you don't understand any of these concepts. Check all the resources and check all the google results. Practice, and get comfortable. It's not about building apps. You just simply download from Github, and claim that it is yours. You have to understand what's really going on. You know, I've been always straight up telling the truth if you've ever read any of my articles in terms opinions.

The only way for you to learn something, is through struggling, and if you are getting confused at all, you are challenging yourself. So, keep learning. Keep visualizing. Keep imaging instead of consuming only. I've attached resources for you to to become a better iOS or Swfit developer. Check those out. You will be surprised how many people commented on the bottom saying they didn't know. But, we've covered everything except functional programming. Again, if you want to get updates for the upcoming course with RxSwift and Functional Programming with MVVM, send me an email to register. If you are learning with me, I don't have sell you too much. It's just going to be good.
