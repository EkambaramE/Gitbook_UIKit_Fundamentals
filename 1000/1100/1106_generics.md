# Generics

## Introduction
Welcome back to Lesson 6 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, "generic", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought you want to write code that can work with many other types. Haha, I know you are super confused, I will walk you through. But remember, the number goal is to write reusable code so that we do not repeat ourself.

## Conclusion
That's it! Generics are such a powerful tool to the point the Swift library is, in fact, created with generic code, not all , but many. To recap, you've learned how to make a generic function by putting a diamond sign on the right. You've also learned how to create generic struct as well as how to put a type constraint. You've learned a lot. I'm very proud of you. You might not find generics as useful in this course, but when you start learning practical protocol oriented programming, functional programming, and rx reactive which is going to my next upcoming course, you will learn how generics dominate everywhere. Use your imagination.
