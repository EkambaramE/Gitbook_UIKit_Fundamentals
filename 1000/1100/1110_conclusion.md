# Conclusion
First of all, I'd like to congratulate on your process. How was learning going for you? We've covered the basics of Swift Intermediate Fundamentals many books and courses skip due to complexity.

You've only covered the very basics of Swift. There is so much more for you. In Chapter 2, 3, 4, you will continue to learn Swift with me so that when you start building real apps, you can connect the dots. Steve Jobs once said, when we are at the present moment, we can't really understand how certain incidents or knowledge build our future. He said, however, when you look into the past, you understand how the dots are connected. For example, Steve Jobs took calligraphy course in college. The skill he learned allowed him to produce beautiful products.

 I already know your future, of course within this course. I've designed this course in terms of what you are going to learn. If you feel as if you don't really know why you are learning this,  when you start making real apps in Part 2 and Part 3, you will start to see how everything fits together. So, if you will, please follow my lead, and I want you to to learn, and if I fail that particular job, I'm not qualified to teach.

 So, let's continue learn Swift fundamentals with me so that when you start to create apps, you understand how Swift is applied in the iOS ecosystem. Let's begin. I'm really happy for you to be here.
