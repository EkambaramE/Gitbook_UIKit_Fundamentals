# Subscripts

## Introduction
Welcome back to lesson 7 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob. What if I told you right now that you can create a shortcut? I know it sounds super super abstract. But, I will walk you through. I know you guys trust me more than any. Let's dive into it.


## Lecture Notes
### Problem
I want a shortcut without calling a method.

### Normal Method
Create a class called, `HelloKitty` which contains a method that returns a string value.

```swift
struct HelloKitty {
  func saySomething() -> String {
    return "I'm Cute"
  }
}
```

Create an instance and call `saySomething()`
```swift
let babe = HelloKitty()
babe.saySomething()
```

### Subscripts
Subscripts provide shortcuts. It is analogous to creating a method but without a name.

```swift

struct WeekDays {
  var days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]

  subscript(index: Int) -> String {
    return days[index]
  }  
}
```

#### Access Shortcut

Call the subscript by entering `[]`.
```swift
let myDays = WeekDays()

myDays[0]  // "Monday"
myDays[1]  // "Tuesday"
```

### Dictionary
When you access elements in a dictionary, it always returns an optional type.

```swift
var info = ["Height": 183, "Body Fat": 12.5, "Weight": 76]

let height = info["Height"] // height is an optional string
```

### Artificial Dictionary Subscript
Access element without returning an optional type
```swift
struct HealthInfo {
  var info = ["Height": 183, "Body Fat": 12.5, "Weight": 76]

  subscript(key: String) -> Double {
    if let newInfo = info[key] {
      return newInfo
    } else {
      return 0
    }
  }

}
```
#### Access Elements
Return normal type

```swift
let bob = HealthInfo()
bob["Height"]         // 183
bob["Body Fat"]        // 12.5
bob["123456789"]       // 0
```

### Shortcoming of Subscript
No Context means ☠️

## Conclusion
Great, Now do you know what I mean by creating a shortcut? I'm sure now you do. I told you so. However, subscripts can be quite misleading because there is no name to it. As a result, it might confusion if your teammate starts to read your code, and he/she might get confused. So make sure, don't use it too often. Somtimes, it might be better for you to use a property or method for clarity. An Apple engineering once said, brevity is not the worthwhile goal. Communication is important because programming language is not only the way humans talk to computers, but also between a human to human.
