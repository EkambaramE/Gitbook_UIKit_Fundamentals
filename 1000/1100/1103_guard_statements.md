# Guard Statement
## Introduction
Super welcome back. We are at lesson 3 of Part 1 of Swift fundamentals with Bob. First of all, let me share with you a story of mine first. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an `else-if` statement. It wasn't a big deal. For example, if something is true, you run this block, if not, else, you run that. However, a `guard` statement confused the heck out of me. I don't know why. Maybe some of you guys feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a `guard statement` is just another for you to write an `else-if` statement. But a guard statement provides a feeling zen which means clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Well, let's find out why.

## Conclusion
Boom, What's going on? How was the lesson just now? I hope you understand the power of using a `guard` statement that it provides an early exit and you don't have to read all the way to the bottom. You are using a `guard` statement not because just to please yourself, but also for the sake of your teammate's hair so it doesn't turn grey when he/she is reading your code. Okay, great. In next our lesson, we are going to learn another `!` and `?` for type casting which allows you to convert types. Let's find out!
