# Course Expectation
Based on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, it doesn't mean your learning journey is not all about butterflies and rainbows. In fact, you will suffer, and I want it that way. Let me explain.

## Learning is done by you
If you aren’t struggling, then you are not learning and you are staying in your conform zone. Our brain doesn't want to consume information. Putting knowledge into one basket goes against the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Simply put, things in nature want to scatter. It doesn’t mean learning or struggles can’t be fun. Perhaps, ask why people climb the Mt.Everest despite death threat. It’s because of a story, and the hardship makes success greater. I just want you to embrace that you will and have to suffer.

I want you to document your learning journey. You don't even need to create a website. You may blog on Medium or use Evernote. You may share with others. Although your journey was hard, when you finally get it and share, you feel great. In fact, that's why I love blogging.

## Excuses
If your English isn’t good, go to YouTube, You guys probably noticed, in fact, it is my second language as well. I also don’t have a computer science degree. All I did was I went to public libraries and read books and took notes. If I'm able to learn, you should as well.  You've got amazing resources available online. If you can afford buying either a Mac or an iPhone, you have more than plenty of resources around you.


## Be skeptical
Don't trust me all the way.  If you spot any practices that you don’t like, make sure challenge me and research how you can do it better. I’m biased, and I might have bad practices although I try to prevent through doing my homework. Feel free to challenge and discuss.

## Do not listen to Xcode
You might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what's really happening underneath. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Never ever click those red notifications on the left side without knowing what’s going on, and how you can prevent them in the future.


> I mentioned that learning was done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.


# Your Ideal Learning Stage
### 1. The Why
Each lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions that I had. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn such materials and features

### 2. Application
After having gone through a specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.

### 3. Resources
I attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.

### 4. Visualization
It's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world there aren't many fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future apps. Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough in 2017, by the current education system.

### 5. Testing
It's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new.
